

Telangana Chief Minister 
and Telangana Rashtra Samiti President K Chandrasekhar 
Rao on Wednesday launched the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), the 
new name of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS), 
marking his first step toward becoming a national 
party ahead of the 2024 elections. 
The launch took place at 
1.19 p.m. on Wednesday. 
The plan was materialised at the State General Body 
meeting of ministers, MPs, 
MLAs, MLCs and district level coordinators 
among other leaders at the party 
headquarters Telangana 
Bhavan in Hyderabad. 
K Chandrashekar Rao 
presided over the meeting. JD(S) leader and former 
Karnataka chief minister 
HD Kumaraswamy along with 20 of his MLAs 
attended the launch event at the TRS headquarters. 
The party also made necessary amendments to its constitution in the 
same meeting and sent the resolution and the amended party 
Constitution to the Election 
Commission of India (ECI) which was 
accepted by the 
Commission.
Later in a press statement, 
KCR clarified the broad as -pects for launching a national party. In the statement, he 
said, “It is not a hasty decision to float a national party. India is a 
union of states. Comprehensive development is possible only if the 
states and the country de-velop together.”
KCR outlined the two areas of his priorities: Gender and caste discrimination. 
“Due to gender discrimination, women, who constitute 
half of the country’s population, are not taking part 
in the development. Dalits 
could not take part in the development of the country 
due to caste discrimination. Both women’s powerand Dalit’s 
power have been weakened and the development 
is not taking place.” 
KCR indicated that his national party will thrive for bringing the fundamental
changes in the society. He said, “Radiant India needs 
to be made. India will grow 
better than America if the resources in the country 
used at optimum level. 
We still have a good time. We will expand across the 
country.” KCR has planned 
to travel the country in a bid to expand his party’s base 
and also try to unite a fragmented Opposition. Maharashtra would be the first 
state where KCR is planning 
to travel. 
Earlier in May this year, 
KCR in his bid to unite the Opposition to take on 
the BJP at the Centre in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, 
held a meeting with former Prime Minister HD Deve 
Gowda in Bengaluru where he discussed an alternative 
political outfit to the BJP.

In a major announcement, 
Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday said 
that the elections will be held 
in Jammu and Kashmir with 
“full transparency” as soon 
as the work of compiling the voters’ list is completed. 
Shah said that manner in 
which delimitation has been done in the region, 
representatives of the people’s choice will be elected. 
“ As soon as the work of compiling the 
voters’ list is completed, elections will be held 
in J&K with full transparency. 
Earlier the delimitation 
was done in such a way 
that only the representatives from the three families 
would be elected, no matter 
what you do. The delimitation that Election Commission has 
done, your own representatives will 
win the elections and rule,” Shah said while 
addressing a rally in Baramulla on the last 
day of his three-day visit to J-K.
Assembly polls to elect the government in the Union 
Territory are due since the abrogation of Articles 
370 and 35A on 5 August 2019. The Centre while 
abrogating the special status of the region, had said that the status 
of state will be given to Jammu and Kashmir at the appropriate 
time and the elections will be held after delimitation.
The orders of the Delimitation Commission were effective 
from 20 May with the Centre choosing the day for 
the move using powers of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Reorganisation Act, 2019. 
As per the final Delimitation Order, out of the 90 
Assembly Constituencies (ACs) in Jammu and Kashmir, 
43 will be part of the Jammu region and 47 for 
the Kashmir region keeping in view the provisions of 
Section 9(1)(a) of the Delimitation Act, 2002 and 
Section 60(2)(b) of Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization 
Act, 2019. 
The Delimitation Commission was entrusted with 
the work of delimiting the Assembly and Parliamentary 
Constituencies in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir on the 
basis of the 2011 Census and in accordance with the provisions 
of Part- V of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Reorganisation Act, 2019 (34 of 2019) and the 
provisions of Delimitation Act, 2002(33 of 2002).

Dussehra rallies on Wedensday turned to be open battle grounds for Shiv Sena, led 
by Uddhav Thakeray and 
Eknath Shinde. Both the warring groups made political statements from their 
respective rallies, deviating from the rituals and religious fervour.
From the traditional 
Shivaji Park Dussehra rally, 
former Maharashtra Chief 
Minister Uddhav Thackeray took a dig at his bete noire 
the Chief Minister Eknath 
Shinde, sayng that “different Ravana will burn this time.” 
“What will happen to Shiv 
Sena? Seeing the crowd here, the question now is, what 
will happen to the traitors? All have gathered together. 
Like every year, this time too 
Ravana will burn. But this time Ravana is different,” 
he told the crowd at Shivaji 
Park.
On the other hand, Shinde 
who was holding a paral-lel rally at the MMRDA grounds, a short way off 
from Thackeray’s home, 
Matoshree. For the first time since the Shiv Sena’s 
inception 56 years ago, two 
Dussehra rallies are being held in Mumbai by the 
rival factions.
Shinde, who toppled the 
Thackeray-led coalition government few months ago, 
shared a Hindi couplet 
by famous Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan that said whosoever is his heir 
will be his son and not the 
other way round. The refer-ence of ‘heir’ was an indirect 
dig at Sena supremo and his 
son Aaditya Thackeray.  
“My son, being my son will 
not be my heir, whoever will be my heir will be my son,” 
read Bachchan’s couplet 
posted by Shinde loosely

Rashtriya Swayamsevak 
Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on Wednesday said 
that it is “neither the nature 
of the Sangh nor Hindus” 
to endanger the minorities 
while also adding that the RSS resolves to stand on the 
side of brotherhood. 
Addressing the occasion 
of the Vijayadashmi festival 
here, where mountaineer Santosh Y adav was the chief 
guest, Bhagwat said, “Scaremongering is done among minorities that there 
is a danger to them because of us 
or Hindus. This has not happened in the past, nor will it 
happen in future. This is neither the nature of Sangh nor of the Hindus.” 
He said that “neither threatens nor gets threatened” is the kind of Hindu 
society that is needed. 
“Self-defence and defence 
of our own become a duty for everyone against those 
who spread hatred, commit 
injustice and atrocity, and 
engage in acts of hooliganism and enmity towards society. ‘Neither threatens nor 
gets threatened’, this kind 
of Hindu society that is the need of the present times. 
This is not anti-anybody. Sangh resolves to stand on 
the side of brotherhood, amity and peace,” he said. 
“The second type of obstacle that hinders our Sanatana Dharma is created by 
forces who are inimical to 
Bharat’s unity and progress. 
They spread fake narratives, 
encourage anarchy, engage 
in criminal acts,  
foment terror, 
conflict and social 
unrest,” Bhagwat 
added. 
The RSS chief said that the 
Sangh will “keep emphasizing the word Hindu”.
“The concept of Hindu 
Rashtra is being discussed 
all over. Many agree with the concept but are opposed to 
the word ‘Hindu’ and prefer 
to use other words. We don’t have any issue 
with that. For the clarity of concept - we 
will keep emphasizing the 
word Hindu for ourselves,” he said. 
Calling for a comprehensive policy on population, Bhagwat 
said that religionbased population imbalance 
is an important subject not to be ignored. 
“Population control and 
religion-based population balance is an important subject that 
can no longer be ignored So a comprehensive population policy should 
be brought and should be equally applicable to all. 
Only then rules pertaining to 
population control will yield 
results,” he said.

Lambasting the National Conference chief 
Farooq Abdullah and 
Peoples Democratic Party 
president Mehbooba Mufti 
on their demands that the Centre should talk to Pakistan, Union Home Minister 
Amit Shah on Wednesday 
said that he would prefer to talk to the youth of 
Jammu and Kashmir rather than 
talking to the neighbouring 
country. 
Addressing a public meeting here, on the last day of his three-day visit 
to the Union Territory which 
would conclude today, Shah 
launched an unsparing attack on former Jammu and 
Kashmir Chief Ministers 
Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti. He accused the 
‘Gupkar  alliance’ of “laying a 
red carpet” for Pakistani ter-rorists into the country. 
Shah said, “Some people 
talk about Pakistan here. I want to tell them today, 
bring the statistics about the number of villages in PoK 
that have electricity. Electricity has reached every village 
in our Kashmir. Mufti and 
company, and Abdullah and 
sons ruled Kashmir for 70 years, but did not provide 
1 lakh houses, but Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi, from 2014 till 2022, 
has given houses to 1 lakh people in JK.” 
“Those who ruled for 70 
years here suggest me to talk to Pakistan. 
I have a clear view, I do not want to talk to Pakistan, 
I want to talk 
to the Gujjars, Paharis and 
Bakarwals in Baramulla. I want to talk to the youth of 
Kashmir. Think with open 
eyes and minds, those who 
spread terrorism, what good have they done to Kashmir?” 
he said adding that J-K has 
to join the race with other states which are moving 
ahead in the country.
“We do not have to follow 
the path shown by terrorists. I urge you to extend 
your support to us,” said the Home Minister. 
Shah said that the “Peoples’ Alliance for Gupkar Declaration model” 
(PAGD) had presented the youth 
of the region with stones, 
closed colleges and machine guns in their hands, 
whereas Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi’s model has brought 
them education. 
“There are two models. 
One of PM Modi which gives employment, peace 
and brotherhood; and another 
is the Gupkar model which 
led to the Pulwama attack. PM Modi made a hospital 
in Pulwama at an expense 
of Rs 2,000 crore. The Gupkar model is laying the 
red carpet for the Pakistani 
terrorists into the country, whereas the Modi 
model is implementing an investment of Rs 56,000 crore 
on the ground giving employment to the youth. Gupkar model placed stones, closed 
colleges, and machine guns 
in the hands of the youth. Modi model has IIM, IIT, 
AIIMS, NIFT, and NEET 
for the youth. The youth 
wants education not stones 
in their hands,” he said. 
Shah asked the former chief 
ministers about the amount that 
was brought into the region as an investment 
during their respective tenures. 
Shah further accused the “three families” 
of J-K of being responsible for the killings of 
the residents of the region by terrorists. 
“Has terrorism done any good to anybody 
in the world? Can the sympathisers of terror-ism 
tell of any such incident? 42,000 people 
of J-K have been victims of terrorism from 1990 till today. 
Who is responsible for their deaths? The three families that ruled here 
were responsible. Terrorism is moving to-wards extinction,” he said. 
Lauding PM Modi for bringing investment 
into J-K, Shah said that the region which was known to be a 
“terrorist hotspot” has now become a “tourism hotspot”. 
“Earlier, this was a terrorist hotspot, now 
it’s a tourism hotspot. Y ou (Farooq and Mehbooba) gave stones 
and guns in the hands of the youth, whereas PM Modi 
gave laptops and mobiles into their hands by bringing industries here,” Shah said.

With the US hosting Pakistan 
Chief of Army Staff General 
Qamar Javed Bajwa amid 
speculation on revival of high-level security partnership 
between Washington and 
Islamabad, India wants the Biden administration to give 
a strong message to the visiting army chief on terrorism 
emanating from Pakistan’s soil. While keeping a close 
watch over the developments 
in Washington where Bajwa is meeting with the top US 
officials, New Delhi has de-livered Washington a clear 
message about what it expects 
from the Biden administration vis-à-vis this visit. 
“The US must tell the 
army chief in no uncertain 
terms that Pakistan’s action against terror outfits leaves 
a lot to be desired,” sources, 
who are working closely with the diplomats in 
Indian embassy to Washington, told  The 
Daily Guardian. “The Biden administration is already aware of what India wants, 
for Defence Minister Rajnath 
Singh and External Affairs Minister have already apprised their US 
counterparts of their 
disappointment over the US’ evident soft 
corner for Pakistan despite the latter’s terror records,” sources 
said. “Now that the US government is hosting 
Bajwa for an almost week-long visit, the Biden 
administration officials will have sufficient opportunity and time 
to give him a strong message on 
terror issues,” says a diplomat.
Bajwa called on US Secretary 
of Defence Lloyd Austin and 
National Security Advisor Jacob Suvllivan and discussed 
matters of mutual interests, a report 
says. What Indian diplomats 
are keen to know is whether the 
US officials discussed the issue 
of terrorism with the army chief or not, says an official. He will 
also be meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 
Indian diplomats are said to be in 
touch with their US counter-parts to have an idea about what 
is going on there.
Amid Bajwa’s visit to Washington, the statements that came 
from Union Home Minister Amit Shah and External Affairs 
Minister S Jaishankar were of great significance.  Addressing a rally at 
Baramulla, Amit Shah on Wednesday ruled out any talks 
with Pakistan while making clear 
that the Narendra Modi government would fully uproot 
terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.    
Just a day ahead of this rally, 
Jaishankar said, “No other country practises terrorism in the 
manner in which Pakistan has done. Y ou show me anywhere 
in the world what Pakistan has 
done for so many years against 
India. After the 26/11 Mumbai attack, it is important for us to 
be clear to ourselves that this 
kind of behaviour and action is unacceptable and there will 
be consequences.” He also said 
while India is considered “expert in IT” (Information Technology), 
the neighbouring country is 
known as an “expert in International Terrorism”.
Sources told TDG that these 
statements from the top Indian ministers must have served the purpose 
as a blunt message to the American government 
amid its efforts to ramp up ties 
with Pakistan. The Pak Army 
chief being hosted by the Biden 
administration lends credence to Washington ignoring Islamabad’s poor record in tackling 
terrorism, says an official. In 
another significant development that has come amid Bajwa’s 
visit to US, Union Home Ministry has designated 10 members 
of Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), 
Lashkare Taiba (LeT) and other proscribed outfits as terrorists 
under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Most 
of these designated terrorists are 
presently based in Pakistan, and 
they have been involved in gruesome killings 
of innocent civil-ians in Jammu and Kashmir. 
Several evidences have recently 
emerged to establish Pakistan’s army’s connivance with 
terror-ists who were arrested in the 
valley over the past few weeks. 
Sources said that the Home Ministry’s move to designate these 
Pakistan-based individuals as 
terrorists could not have come at a more appropriate time than 
this, as Pakistan’s army chief is in 
Washington and all eyes are on the US to see if the 
government in Washington even seeks explanation from 
him on fight against terror. This may be part 
of India’s strategy to ramp up pressure on 
the US government to call out 
Pakistan over terrorism.

Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday expressed 
confidence in the armed forces of the country and said that they are 
the “pride of the nation”.  
“We are confident that our country is safe in the hands of 
our armed forces. The 
jawans of our armed forces 
and paramilitary forces are the pride of our country,” 
Rajnath Singh said after 
performing ‘Shastra Puja’ in the presence of Army Chief General 
Manoj Pande at the Auli Military Station in Uttarakhand. 
He further said that India 
is the only country where 
“Shaastra” as well as “Shastra” are worshipped. Singh’s remarks came 
while he was interacting with the 
Army jawans deployed at 
the forward post located on 
the China border in Uttarakhand.
He was also seen with the 
latest weapons and machines used by the Army in 
the forward areas. He performed the ‘puja’ to mark the celebrations of Vijaya -dashmi, 
which is celebrated to bid adieu to Goddess Durga representing a day 
that marks the triumph of 
good over evil. 
According to mythology on 
this day Goddess Durga annihilated the demon god Mahishasura 
after a fierce battle that lasted for nine days.  
The day is also celebrated to mark the victory of Lord 
Ram over the king of Lanka, 
Ravana. 
Dussehra is marked with 
religious enthusiasm across the country. Ramlila, the 
dramatic folk reenactment of the life of Lord Ram is 
staged for 10 days and concludes on Dussehra. 
Effigies of the ten headed 
demon king Ravana, his brother Kumbhakaran 
and son Indrajit are burnt 
with fireworks to signify 
the destruction of evil.  
Rajnath Singh is on a twoday visit to Uttarakhand 
from Tuesday to celebrate 
the festival of Vijayadashmi with Jawans. Later, 
he arrived at Badridham and offer prayers at the Badrinath 
temple. On Tuesday, he also had 
‘Bada Khana’ with the sol-diers in Dehradun.

Highlighting the development push by the BJP led 
Centre in Jammu and Kashmir, Union Home Minister 
Amit Shah on Wednesday said the region that was 
a terrorist hotspot earlier 
has now become a tourist hotspot due to the policies of

3-day visit to J-K, inaugurated and laid the foundation 
stone of 240 development projects of about Rs 
2,000 crore in Srinagar

translated from Hindi. Slamming Thackeray, Shinde said 
that if Balasaheb Thackeray 
had been alive, Narayan Rane would have become

CM added. 
Balasaheb Thackeray’s 
son Jaidev Thackeray came to show his support and 
shared the stage with Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde during the Dussehra rally 
at Mumbai’s BKC ground on Wednesday. Extending support to CM Shinde, 
Jaidev Thackeray said, 
“Don’t leave Eknath Shinde alone. He is working 
for farmers and commoners”.  
Maharashtra CM Eknath 
Shinde and leaders from 
his faction attended the Shiv Sena Dussehra

of arms) was performed 
for the 51 feet sword for which a Mahant was called 
from Ayodhya in UP.  
Shinde lambasted his former party leader Uddhav Thackeray over the alliance 
with Congress and called 
him a traitor. “Balasaheb Thackeray made an alliance 
with BJP. Y ou did gaddari, 
we are not gaddar. Y ou have committed a sin go apologise to Balasaheb samadhi at

Union Home Minis- 
ter Amit Shah, in 
a security review 
meeting here, on Wednesday 
directed the strengthening of 
the security grid to ensure 
zero fear of terrorists and 
separatists.
The Minister also reviewed 
the working of the security 
grid and the progress made 
on various items of the se- 
curity agenda in previous 
meetings to reduce the in- 
cidents of terrorism and the 
stranglehold of the separat- 
ist networks over the sys- 
tem. Shah's direction came 
during the security review 
meeting earlier in the day. 
The Lieutenant Governor 
ment of India, including the 
Army, Central Armed Police 
Forces, Jammu and Kashmir 
Police, and the officials of the 
Union Territory, attended 
the meeting. 
The Minister asked security forces and the police to 
pro-actively conduct coordi- 
nated counter-terrorism op- 
erations to fulfil Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi's vision 
of a prosperous and peaceful 
Jammu and Kashmir.
Shah appreciated the efforts 
of the security agencies 
and administration of the 
Union Territory of Jammu 
and Kashmir for keeping 
the streets free from violence 
and significantly restoring 
the Rule of Law.
Noting that the 'Har Ghar 
Tiranga' campaign during 
the Independence Day cel- 
ebrations saw a new level 
of unprecedented enthu- 
siasm, the Home Minister 
exhorted the security forces 
and the police to continue 
with the coordinated efforts 
of Jammu and Kashmir, 
Manoj Sinha, and other se- 
nior officials of the Governthrough meticulous and 
well-planned counter 
terrorism operations to wipe 
out terrorism.
The cases registered un- 
der the Unlawful Activities 
(Prevention) Act were also 
reviewed, and it was stressed 
that the investigation should 
be timely and effective.
"The agencies concerned 
should work on improving 
capacities to ensure qual- 
ity investigation. The terror 
eco-system, comprising ele- 
ments that aid, abet and sus- 
tain the terrorist-separatist 
campaign to the detriment 
of the well being of the com- 
mon man, requires to be 
completely dismantled," 
said the Home Minister.

Taking swift and strong 
action, an Army Court 
Martial has recommended 
dismissal from service and 
a one year jail term for a 
non commissioned officer 
(NCO) found guilty of 
sexually harassing a female 
Captain.
The incident took place 
last year when the lady of- 
ficer had come to Sikkim 
for a river rafting course 
in the 17th Mountain Divi- 
sion area where she was 
staying in official accom- 
modation. In the court 
martial convened by the 17 
Mountain Division in Sikkim, 
the Havildar has been 
accused of using criminal 
force while attempting to 
outrage the modesty of the 
female officer belonging to 
the Military Nursing Service, 
Army officials said 
here.
The second charge 
against the NCO was that 
after forcefully entering 
the room of the officer, he 
made "sexually coloured" 
remarks, they said. 
Once the incident hap- 
pened, the lady officer 
managed to escape from 
the room and complained 
to the authorities there 
about the incident.
The Army authorities act- 
ed swiftly and the NCO was 
put through a trial process 
where he was found guilty. 
The court martial took 
place in the 617 EME battalion 
in Sikkim and the 
jawan was recommended 
to face a one year jail term 
along with dismissal from 
service last week.
The President Officer in 
the case was Lt Col Deep- 
ak Shahi, while the pros- 
ecution counsel was lawyer 
Akshit Anand.
The Indian Army has 
been very strict in cases of 
moral turpitude and financial 
misappropriation. In 
the last few years, several 
officers and men have been 
dismissed from service in 
these cases.

Deputy Leader of the INC 
in the Lok Sabha Gaurav 
Gogoi on Tuesday said that 
the Bharatiya Janata Party's 
(BJP) steps are "draconian" 
after Congress lost its chair- 
manship of the parliamentary 
committee on IT.
He alleged that the BJP is 
building the foundation of a 
surveillance state where cit- 
izens' rights are subjugated 
and institutional checks are 
obliterated. "A draconian 
step by the BJP. It seems 
like Prime Minister Modi is 
fascinated by Chinese sin- 
gle-party rule and the Rus- 
sian oligarchy model. He is 
building the foundation of a 
surveillance state where citizens' 
rights are subjugated 
and institutional checks are 
obliterated," tweeted Gogoi. 
A major reshuffle took 
place in the parliamentary 
panels on Tuesday as Con- 
gress lost the Home and the 
crucial Information Tech- 
nology and Communica- 
tions panels, among others.

notification, Congress lead- 
er Abhishek Manu Singhvi, 
who headed the Home pan- 
el, was replaced by BJP Ra- 
jya Sabha MP and former

Lal, who has been named as  
the new chair.
Another loss for the grand 
old party is losing the com- 
mittee on IT, which was 
chaired by Lok Sabha MP 
Dr Shashi Tharoor. The 
Eknath Shinde-led fac- 
tion of Shiv Sena now has 
its chairman in three-time

The Congress party cur- 
rently controls the Standing 
Committee on Environment

remains as its chairman.
Professor Ram Gopal Yadav 
from the Samajwadi 
party, who had been hold- 
ing the post for a long time 
as chairman of the Health 
Committee, has been replaced 
by BJP MP Bhubaneshwar Kalita.
It will be the loss of a committee 
for DMK as the party

Taking swift and strong 
action, an Army Court 
Martial has recommended 
dismissal from service and 
a one year jail term for a 
non commissioned officer 
(NCO) found guilty of 
sexually harassing a female 
Captain.
The incident took place 
last year when the lady of- 
ficer had come to Sikkim 
for a river rafting course 
in the 17th Mountain Division 
area where she was 
staying in official accom- 
modation. In the court 
martial convened by the 17 
Mountain Division in Sikkim, 
the Havildar has been 
accused of using criminal 
force while attempting to 
outrage the modesty of the 
female officer belonging to 
the Military Nursing Service, 
Army officials said here.
The second charge 
against the NCO was that 
after forcefully entering 
the room of the officer, he 
made "sexually coloured" 
remarks, they said. 
Once the incident hap- 
pened, the lady officer 
managed to escape from 
the room and complained 
to the authorities there 
about the incident.
The Army authorities acted 
swiftly and the NCO was 
put through a trial process 
where he was found guilty. 
The court martial took 
place in the 617 EME battalion 
in Sikkim and the 
jawan was recommended 
to face a one year jail term 
along with dismissal from 
service last week.
The President Officer in 
the case was Lt Col Deep 
ak Shahi, while the prosecution 
counsel was lawyer 
Akshit Anand.
The Indian Army has 
been very strict in cases of 
moral turpitude and finan- 
cial misappropriation. In 
the last few years, several 
officers and men have been 
dismissed from service in 
these cases.

The building owner accused 
in Delhi's Mundka fire case 
has moved a revision petition 
challenging an order denying 
default bail to him by a trial 
court. The petitioner moved 
the application seeking bail 
over the non-filing of the 
charge sheet in the case. The 
application was dismissed by 
the court.
Additional Sessions Judge 
Hem Raj of Tees Hazari Court 
listed the petition for further 
hearing on September 13 after 
hearing the initial arguments. 
Manish Lakra has moved the 
petition through advocates 
Pradeep Kumar Arya and 
Kapil Dhaka, challenging the 
order of the Magistrate Court 
passed on August 6, 2022, de- 
nying bail to him.
This case pertains to a fire 
incident in the Mundka area 
on May 13 in which 27 people 
were killed. An FIR was regis- 
tered on May 14, 2022, under

IPC, at the Police Station, 
Mundka. The petitioner was 
arrested on May 15, 2022, and 
was produced before the court 
the next day. Thereafter, he 
was sent to judicial custody. In 
these circumstances, the peti- 
tioner has been under custody 
since May 15, 2022, i.e., around 
80 days, the petition stated.
The counsel for the accused, 
Manish, submitted that in 
view of the investigations, only 
one offence u/s 304 Part II is 
alleged to be made out against 
the petitioner and, in view of 
the mandate of section 167 
CrPC, the period of comple- 
tion of investigation and filling 
of charge sheet is 60 days if the 
accused is in custody. Thereaf- 
ter, according to Section 167 (2) 
CrPC, the accused is entitled to 
be released on bail.
It is also submitted that the 
right of default bail, which is 
enshrined u/s 167 CrPC, is 
the fundamental and founda- 
tional right of the accused as 
identified under the criminal 
jurisprudence of the land.

On Wednesday, Additional 
Director General of Police 
Mukesh Singh stated that no 
terror link has been discovered 
during the investigation 
into the death of Director 
General (DG) of Prisons HK 
Lohia.
HK Lohia was found dead 
under suspicious circum- 
stances in a house in the 
Udaywala area of Jammu 
on the intervening night 
of Monday and Tuesday, 
and the police had arrested 
the suspected accused, Yasir 
Ahmed, in his killing. 
Ahmed was the househelp 
of DG prisons who had been 
working at Lohia's house 
for nearly six months, and 
he was reported as "quite 
aggressive" and "under depression" 
as per some documentary 
evidence that was 
seized by the police reflecting his mental state.
"In the initial investigation 
into the incident of Lohia's 
death, it has come to fore that 
one domestic helper, Yasir 
Ahmed, resident of Ramban, 
is the main accused," ADGP 
Mukesh Singh informed on 
Tuesday, adding that the 
CCTV footage collected from 
the incident spot showed 
him running after committing the crime.
"The interrogation with the 
accused is still underway. 
His disclosures in the mat- 
ter are being corroborated 
by the field investigation," 
Singh said, adding that accused 
Ahmed has confessed 
to his crime.

The Economic Offences Wing 
of Delhi Police has arrested a 
woman for allegedly dup- 
ing her neighbours of over 
Rs 1 crore by running a kitty 
and inducing them to invest 
money to get high returns in 
a short period of time.
The accused has been identified 
as Sarla Garg (52), a resident of Delhi's Dwarka who 
used to operate kitty parties 
in her society. It has been alleged that the accused has 
duped more than 25 people 
by inducing them to get high 
returns in a shorter period of 
time.
A case was registered 
against the accused on the 
joint complaints of 28 people 
under sections 406, 420, 
120(B) and 34 of the Indian 
Penal Code.
The complaints alleged that 
the accused used to run a kitty 
scheme from her residence 
and had collected about Rs 
1.01 crore from the victims.
"She had promised to re- 
turn the matured amount 
within 15 months, but even 
after passing of the maturity 
period, she neither returned 
the principal amount nor paid 
any profit to the investors. After
a few months, Sarla along 
with her family members left 
her address and shifted to 
some other unknown place," 
the victims had alleged. 
The accused used her WhatsApp 
mobile number to chat 
with the victims and send the 
kitten scheme messages.

The Supreme Court 
has asked West Ben- 
gal, Uttar Pradesh 
and several other states to 
file responses on issues relating 
to the implementation 
of Real Estate (Regulation 
and Development) Act within
four weeks or their prin- 
cipal secretaries in charge of 
housing departments would 
have to make personal appearances before it. 
A bench of Justices D.Y. 
Chandrachud and Hima 
Kohli said that if the state 
governments failed to file 
their responses their prin- 
cipal secretaries have to ap- 
pear before the court and explain as to why they should 
not be proceeded with under 
the coercive arm of the law. 
The apex court noted that 
despite a previous order dated 12 August 12, requiring 
the states and Union Terri- 
tories to file their responses 
with the Union Ministry of 
Housing and Urban Affairs 
by 2 September 2, Andhra 
Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya 
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Ut- 
tar Pradesh, and West Bengal, have not submitted their 
responses. 
“The States which have not 
filed their responses shall do 
so positively within a period 
of four weeks from today, 
failing which the Principal 
Secretaries of the State Government in the Ministry of 
Urban Development/Affairs shall personally remain 
present before this Court 
on the next date of hearing 
to explain as to why they 
should not be proceeded 
with under the coercive arm 
of the law,” the order of the 
top court stated. 
Earlier, the apex court 
asked the chief secretaries 
of all the states and Union 
Territories to respond to 
the queries raised by the 
central government on the 
implementation of RERA 
Act, 2016 rules in their jurisdiction.
The order of the top court 
came while hearing a plea 
filed by advocate Ashwini 
Upadhyay seeking direc- 
tion to the Centre to frame a 
model Builder-Buyer agreement and model Agent 
Buyer agreement in order to 
infuse transparency, reduce 
fraud and restrain builders 
and promoters from indulging in arbitrary unfair and 
restrictive trade practices.

The Supreme Court has said 
that granting compassion- 
ate employment is intended 
to enable the family to tide 
over the sudden crisis by 
providing a source of livelihood 
and should not be considered as a right. 
The apex court’s remark 
came while setting aside a 
Bombay High Court order 
which directed to appoint 
the respondent woman, who 
was married and youngest 
daughter of the deceased, 
on compassionate ground 
in the Water Resources Department in Maharashtra. 
The top court observed 
that the respondent woman 
cannot be said to be dependent on the deceased 
employee, i.e., her mother. 
The court observed that 
compassionate appointment is an exception to the 
general rule of appointment 
in the public services and is 
in favour of the dependents 
of a deceased dying in harness and leaving his family 
in penury and without any 
means of livelihood, and in 
such cases, out of pure hu- 
manitarian consideration 
taking into consideration 
the fact that unless some 
source of livelihood is provided, the family would not 
be able to make both ends 
meet, a provision is made in 
the rules to provide gainful 
employment to one of the 
dependants of the deceased 
who may be eligible for such 
employment. 
“The whole object of granting compassionate 
employment is, thus, to enable the 
family to tide over the sudden crisis.”

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation 
(DMRC) has once 
again failed to honour the 
Delhi High Court order directing it to pay Rs 4,500 
crore arbitral award to the 
Reliance Infrastructure 
subsidiary’s Delhi Airport 
Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL) within four 
weeks. 
In the last six months, 
this is the third contempt 
of the High Court order by 
DMRC. The Delhi High 
Court, in its last order dated September 6, 2022, had 
directed DMRC to pay the 
entire amount of Arbitral 
Award of Rs 4,500 crore 
due to DAMEPL in four 
weeks’ time i.e. by 4 October, yet it failed to comply 
with the order of the court 
as it did not make any payment to DAMEPL as the 
deadline ended yesterday. Legal team DAMEPL 
said that it has been almost 
13 months now that the 
DAMEPL, despite a decree in its favour from the 
Supreme Court, followed 
by 3 orders from the Delhi 
High Court on its execution plea, directing DMRC 
to make the payment, has 
been struggling to get its 
dues from DMRC. 
Earlier in March 2022, 
the Delhi High Court, after 
hearing the execution plea 
of DAMEPL, passed an 
order on March 10, 2022, 
directing DMRC to pay the 
entire amount in two equal 
instalments by April 30 and 
May 31, 2022. DMRC failed 
to comply with this order. 
DAMEPL again approached the Delhi HC to 
enforce the order dated 
March 10. The court then 
passed an order on June 20 
directing DMRC to make 
the full payment by August 
5 2022. DMRC failed to 
comply with this order, too. 
In the last order dated 6 
September, the court had 
also directed that if the 
amount is not paid within 
four weeks, the court shall 
be constrained to call the 
appearance of the Managing Director of the DMRC 
before the court.
The next hearing is scheduled on October 10, 2022.

A Delhi Court on Wednesday granted one day 
custody of six accused to Delhi Police for 
interrogation in connection with the alleged murder of a 
youth Manish in the Sunder Nagri area of North 
East Delhi. He had been stabbed multiple times 
before death on the evening of Saturday. 
Duty Magistrate Ajeet Narayan of Karkardooma 
Court sent Bilal, Faizan, Alam, Sajid, Mohsin and 
Shakir to one-day police custody in a case of the 
alleged murder of Manish. Investigation officer (IO) 
Inspector Karmveer informed the court that Sajid 
was arrested yesterday. Mohsin and Shakir were 
arrested from the jail. Faizan, Bilal and Alam were 
produced from judicial custody. 
IO submitted that Sajid is the brother of accused 
Mohsin. He met Mohsin in jail. Thereafter, he pre- 
pared Faizan, Bilal and Alam and provided them 
weapons to commit crime. The trio allegedly 
committed the crime of killing Manish. 
IO submitted before the court that a one day 
police custody is required to confront the accused 
and get all the necessary clues related to his death. 
According to the police FIR, Mohsin and Shakir 
were arrested earlier in a case of attempt to murder of Manish. 
The deceased was the complain- 
ant and main witness in that case. He was being 
continuously threatened by the brother and family 
of Mohsin to withdraw the case and not to give a 
statement in the court. 
Manish and his mother had attended the court 
proceedings on 28 September and he was allegedly 
murdered on the evening of 1 October. 
The Court on Tuesday remanded Faizan, Bilal 
and Alam to one-day judicial custody. The three 
accused were produced before the court after 2 
days of police custody. The court granted two-day 
police custody on 2 October. 
Manish was allegedly murdered by stabbing on 
Saturday evening in the Sunder Nagri area. This 
incident was captured in the CCTV. A case for 
murder and other relevant sections were lodged 
at Nand Nagri police station.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 
Wednesday inaugurated the 
All India Institute of Medical 
Sciences (AIIMS) at Kothipura 
in Bilaspur district. The 
Rs 1471 crore, 750-bed premier 
medical institute is set 
up to provide people in the 
region with super specialty 
medical treatment.
The Prime Minister also inaugurated the Rs 140 crore 
Government Hydro Engineering College at Bandla in 
Bilaspur. He also laid foundation stones for the Rs 350 
crore Medical Devices Park 
to be set up at Nalagarh and 
the Pinjore-Nalagarh fourlane road 
project to be constructed under the Bharat 
Mala project at a cost of Rs 
1692 crore.
While addressing a mammoth public meeting at the 
historic Luhnu ground in 
Bilaspur, the Prime Minister 
greeted the people in the local Bilaspur dialect. He said 
that the All India Institute 
of Medical Sciences at Bilaspur would be known as 
the “Green AIIMS” as it has 
been built in an ecofriendly 
manner. He said that AIIMS 
Bilaspur would not only 
increase access to affordable 
healthcare in the state 
but also provide specialized 
health care facilities to the 
people of the region nearer 
to their homes. He stated 
that the Centre Government 
has worked for the last eight 
years to ensure that the benefits 
of development reach 
the most remote parts of the 
country.
The Prime Minister said 
that the State of Himachal 
Pradesh has played a crucial 
role in guarding the frontiers 
of the nation (Rashtra Raksha) 
and now the AIIMS 
would go a long way in making 
Himachal a destination 
for “Jeevan Raksha”. 
Narendra Modi said that 
Himachal Pradesh was one 
of the three states chosen 
‘green aiimS’ in BilaSPur 
to the nation
for establishing bulk drug 
parks and one of the four 
states chosen for medical 
device parks. He said that 
credit for this goes to the 
faith and support the people 
of the state have provided to 
the Centre Government. He 
said that medical tourism 
was another important sector 
that needed to be promoted 
in Himachal so that when 
people from across the world 
come to India, they should 
visit Himachal as the state 
has a beautiful and healthy 
environment.
While welcoming Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi to 
Himachal Pradesh, CM Jai 
Ram Thakur said that the 
people of the state would 
always remain indebted to the 
love and benevolence showered 
by the Prime Minister 
on the state. He said that 
providing AIIMS to a small 
state like Himachal Pradesh 
with only 70 lakh popula- 
tion shows the concern of 
the Prime Minister towards 
the development of the state 
and the welfare of the people 
of Himachal Pradesh. 
He also thanked the Prime 
Minister for dedicating developmental 
projects worth 
Rs. 3653 crore to the State 
today. He also thanked the 
Prime Minister for always 
being concerned about the 
developmental needs and 
aspirations of the state and 
its people.

and expressed his happiness 
to be a part of the Interna- 
tional Kullu Dussehra Festival 
that is to be celebrated 
here from October 5 to 11 at

The festival is unique in 
the sense that it is the 
congregation of more than 300 
deities of the valley. On the first 
day of the festival, obeisance 
is paid to the deities in their 
well decorated palanquins 
at the temple of the Chief 
Deity, Bhagwan Raghunath 
Ji, and then it proceeds to the 
Dhalpur Ground.

On Independence Day, referring to the 
Amrit Kaal the next 25 years till 2047, 
when India will be marking 
100 years of Independence 
the Prime Minister urged 
people to focus on “Panch 
Pran” (five vows).
He said the country has 
met various challenges in the 
past 75 years and there were 
certain unfulfilled dreams. 
“The next 25 years are very 
significant for our country.” 
The first vow is for the 
people to move ahead with a 
big resolve for a “developed 
India”. He had said, “We 
should not settle for any thing less than that.”
The second resolve is that 
“in no part of our existence, 
not even in the deepest corners of our minds or habits 
should there be any ounce of 
slavery”.
The third resolve asked the 
countrypersons to feel proud 
of the heritage and legacy of 
India.
He said the fourth resolve, 
which is equally important is 
unity and solidarity.
PM Modi said the fifth vow 
is the “duty of the citizens.

Hospital and enquired about 
his health.
CM Khattar also met former Haryana Chief 
Minister Om Prakash Chautala at

Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam 
Singh Yadav is still critical 
and is currently admitted to 
the ICU and is being treated

The decisive war against 
antisocial elements waged on the 
directions of Chief Minister 
Bhagwant Mann has delivered yet another victory after 
Punjab Police on Wednesday 
busted a drone based arms 
and ammunition smuggling 
module with the arrest of its 
two members, including a 
prisoner.
Those arrested have been 
identified as Jaskaran Singh 
of Bhikhiwind in Tarn Taran, 
currently lodged at Sub Jail 
Goindwal Sahib, and Rattanbir 
Singh of Khemkaran in 
Tarn Taran, out on bail. The 
police also recovered ten foreign made pistols, including 
five. 30 bore (made in China) 
and five 9mm (made in the 
United States by Beretta), as 
well as eight spare magazines 
for both, as well as a mobile 
phone hidden by Jaskaran in 
his barrack.
AIG Counter Intelligence 
(CI) Amritsar Amarjit Singh 
Bajwa said that accused Jaskaran Singh was brought on a 
production warrant in a case 
pertaining to the NDPS act, 
which was registered at SSOC 
Amritsar in August 2022.

During questioning, accused 
Jaskaran confessed that he 
was using a mobile phone in 
jail to contact Pakistan based 
smugglers through What  
sApp for the smuggling of 
narcotics and arms/ammunition from Pakistan via drones. 
The AIG said that for this 
purpose, the accused was taking the help of Rattanbir, who 
was used to retrieving the consignments dropped via drones 
from different border areas. 
Pertinently, Rattanbir is also a 
co-accused in various NDPS 
cases with Jaskaran Singh. 
He said that one consignment of five .30 bore pistols 
along with four spare magazines was recovered from the 
pinpointed location revealed 
by accused Jaskaran at Village 
Pidhi on the Taran TaranFerozepur Road, which was 
concealed by Rattanbir on the 
intervening nights of September 28 and 29, 2022. 
Amarjit Singh Bajwa said 
that acting on Jaskaran’s inputs, the police teams of Coun- 
ter Intelligence Amritsar have 
also managed to arrest Rattanbir from Khemkaran and, on 
his disclosure, and five more 
pistols of 9 MM were recovered along with four spare 
magazines.

An elderly man, working as 
a security guard, was allegedly 
bludgeoned to death in 
the Powai area of Mumbai on 
Tuesday. Both the accused 
and the victim were residents 
of a chawl near an open plot 
in the area.
The incident took place in 
the early hours of the day at 
the JC Builders compound, 
where the deceased, 86 year 
old Limbaji Kamble, worked 
as a security guard. The accused, 
Shripat Dengle, allegedly in an inebriated state, 
beat up the old man with 
sticks after the deceased didn't 
allow him to drink liquor, officials said.
The 58 year old accused 
used to visit the compound, an 
open plot owned by a private 
builder near the Hiranandani 
Hospital in Powai.
On the day of the incident, 
Kamble denied Dengle to consume liquor, which irked the 
latter. Around 4 p.m. on Tuesday Kamble assaulted Dengle 
with wooden sticks, leading to 
the old man's death.
"Shripat Dengle (56) allegedly hit his colleague with sticks 
JOB SCAM
and killed him on the spot following a brawl, which started 
after the old man denied the 
accused the right to consume 
liquor in an open plot on Monday," Mumbai Police said. 
After hearing Kamble's 
screams, some locals ran to 
the spot and called up the 
security guard's son, who 
rushed his father to the Rajawadi Hospital, where he 
was declared dead. 
Mumbai Police have regis-tered a case on the basis of the 
statement given by the family 
members of Kamble against 
Shripat Dengle.

The construction of the 
6-km flyover from Kanal 
Road to Mithi on the Jammu 
Akhnoor highway has been 
completed on which two way traffic has been flowing 
for the past few days.
The construction of a fourlane flyover on the 32-km 
Jammu Akhnoor road up 
to Ganesh Vihar has greatly 
reduced traffic pressure. 
Traffic jams in Kanal Road, 
Talab Talu, Nahar, Mithi, 
and Dumana have become 
a regular occurrence. This 
will now reduce the traffic 
pressure.
The Rs 5,100 crore project 
was announced under the 
Prime Minister's Develop- 
ment Package in November 
2015 for the construction of 
the Rajouri-Poonch highway 
NH-144-A. 
Of this, Rs 917 crore is 
being spent on the Jammu Akhnoor road.
While travelling on the 
flyover, the beautiful view 
of the city of Jammu can be 
seen.
The section where this sixkm flyover is constructed, 
which used to take at least 
30 to 45 minutes to pass 
through, causing severe 
hardship to employees, students, and patients, has now 
been resolved. 
Vehicles going to Akhnoor, 
Poonch, or Rajouri will go 
directly through the flyover, 
while local vehicles will run 
on the road below the flyover. 
Earlier, Union Minister 
of Road Transport and 
Highways Nitin Gadkari 
sanctioned the release of Rs 
562.45 crore worth of funds 
with a  view to further boost 
work on the Akhnoor Poonch National Highway. 
The funds were released 
for the upgrading, widening, 
and strengthening of two lane with paved shoulders. 
"The project for upgradation, widening and

Win, lose or draw 
on the war in 
Ukraine, the 
West, overall, is in trouble 
or at least on a negative 
trajectory, even if it were to 
find a mecca of a cheap energy source. Why?
You could focus on iden- 
tity politics, wokism and 
the creepy ever-growing 
creep of the highly technologically 
advanced security 
state ever widening its net. But I am more into basics 
like long term growth trajectories, labour stability 
and availability, productivity, GNP growth, business 
and commercial friendly 
regulatory environments. 
And secondarily, I focus on 
popular sentiment about 
the future and government. 
Let us look at some good 
examples. Some come from 
Professor Graham Allison 
in his lecture at Harvard 
University (on YouTube) 
on whether there will be 
war between the West and 
China. He gives a whole lot 
of statistics demonstrating 
the overall fast growth of 
the Chinese economy. For 
1978, he shows that 90% 
of the Chinese people were 
living on two dollars or less 
a day and the remarkable 
degree to which mass deep 
poverty in the 1980s has 
become a very small part 
of the China of today. In 
fact, by 2014, and no doubt 
beyond, only one in a hundred 
are living in extreme 
poverty.
As implied by Allison, 
such fast paced progress 
was due to the serious goals 
and time frames, Xi Jinping 
the Chinese leader, his officials and his post Mao 
predecessors set for the 
country on the long term. 
But even a clip from his lecture shows how serious the 
Chinese are about fulfilling 
short term goals. Allison 
showed a time lapse video of 
a small bridge being reconstructed in Beijing done 
entirely in 43 hours all while 
a small bridge near the 
Harvard campus has taken 
years to renovate.
I will add the famed 
doomed California fast train 
system. The Gaurdian (UK) 
headline says it all: “Despite 14 years of work and 
about $5bn spent, the 2008 
promise of quick transport 
between Los Angeles and 
San Francisco has not materialized”. Contrast over 
the same period, as according to Xinhua news, “The 
total length of high speed 
rail lines in China came in at 
about 37,900 km at the end 
of 2020 and was up about 
2,900 km from 2019 and almost twice that of 2015.” 
And what do we have in 
the UK. In Britain, speaking 
of train service, it has been 
on strike. Only an intermission 
due to the passing away 
of the late Queen Elizabeth 
II, interrupted the work 
stoppage. Several years ago 
in a famous report, the current 
UK Prime Minister Liz 
Truss derided the lack of 
work ethic and devotion to 
aspiration by too many native Britons. Many today, as 
polls show, are very uncertain of their future. She even 
went as far as praising the 
greater commitment and 
ambition by many Indian 
immigrants to get ahead. 
Truss seems worried that 
England has been in a too 
low productivity situation 
for way too long which undermines economic growth. 
Piers Morgan, one of England’s most famous talk 
show hosts, goes further in 
a recent YouTube clip. He 
categorizes Britain as essentially a basket case.
An Ash Center poll underscores the important 
contrast between the US 
and China. From the Harvard Gazette: “Survey team 
found that compared to 
public opinion patterns in 
the US, in China, there was 
very high satisfaction with 
the central government. In 
2016, the last year the survey was conducted, 95.5% 
of respondents were either 
‘relatively satisfied’ or ‘highly satisfied’.” It goes on and 
says only 38% in America 
were so.
And speaking of India, 
it has seen extremely fast 
growth, registering well 
over 6% over recent years 
and up to around 12% in 
recent quarters. Its technology sector has been fast 
developing and its major 
companies have been important sources of 
investment capital for England. In 
fact, exogenous capital from 
countries of the South has 
opinion
been an important lifeline 
for British manufacturing, 
not only the Premier football league. Main brands 
like Jaguar to Range Rover 
are owned by Indians. It is 
hard to think how worse off 
the UK would be without 
immigration and invest- 
ment from such, so called 
developing or newly developed countries. Some of 
these patterns of low or insufficient growth and 
productivity and labour issues 
hold up on the continent. 
My view is that it becomes 
increasingly hard to have 
stability without economic 
fundamentals in order. For 
Asia, this has been the practical 
focus wealth and stability. Economic growth is 
intricately connected with 
fairness. A priority that 
cannot be (overly) subordi- 
nated to western values of 
pro-identity politics and beyond, even if a country does 
not meet the US definition 
of democracy, exceptional 
or not?
To be fair, the West has 
reached a very large GNP 
for their population size. 
So, there may be increasing 
limits for high growth rates 
when compared to India, 
Southeast Asia if not China. 
India is said to have an overall 
GNP that has surpassed 
that of the UK.  But the UK 
has a much smaller population and China whose 
economy is fast approaching a size or bigger than 
the US’s. So, what to do to 
clearly boost the economic 
prospects of the West with 
its poor growth prospects 
and negativity among its 
populations about govern- 
ment. All of which is giving 
a bad name to democracy or 
at least western forms.
There needs to be a culture 
change in the West (and Japan). That means welcom- 
ing more entrepreneurship 
and the skilled from places 
like the Commonwealth, yet 
in a more orderly way than 
the madness at the Mexican 
border, Channel or Mediterranean crossings 
of illegals in rickety boats. Many 
more resources should be 
put forward to accelerating 
legitimate and functional 
immigration from the South 
to vitalize “rusty” regions 
of the West. This should be 
done sensibly, not in panicky manner.  As well, the 
diversification as seen in the 
Liz Truss cabinet should 
be a signal that rewarding meritocracy goes hand 
in hand with antiracism. 
Achievement should not be 
overly tied up in quotas but 
pushing and supporting 
excellence and productivity through all layers and 
regions of society. Varied 
sources of foreign investment can help, too. 
Educators have important roles 
in this including raising the 
economic and investment 
IQ among students.
The Ukraine war has not 
only been sad given all the 
deaths of the innocent, refugees and physical 
and environmental destruction. But 
it may have also distracted 
the West from dealing with 
some fundamentals to making democracy more 
attractive, bettering fundamen- 
tally, the West’s economic 
health at large.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s much 
touted Bharat Jodo Yatra (walk to unite India) will 
resume from Mandya on Thursday after giving a 
two-day break due to the ongoing Dasara festival 
in the state. The Bharat Jodo Yatra, which began 
on 7 September from Kanyakumari, has already 
completed 624 km and is currently in Karnataka’s 
Mandya district. His mother and longest serving 
Congress party president, Sonia Gandhi, and his 
sister and Uttar Pradesh General Secretary Priyanka 
Gandhi Vadra, are likely to join him in his yatra 
symbolically in Karnataka. 
For the Gandhi family, Karnataka has always been 
special as it gave political rebirth of sorts to Rahul 
Gandhi’s grandmother, the Late Indira Gandhi, in 
the early 1980s, and his mother Sonia Gandhi won 
her first political battle from the Ballary Lok Sabha 
seat in 1999.  Hence, both Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka 
Gandhi Vadra are likely to join Rahul during his 
second stretch of tour that will resume from Mandya 
on Thursday. Though the place is not decided yet in 
which distrct Priyanka Gandhi Vadra would join her 
brother it is widely reported that Sonia Gandhi 
may join her son’s padayatra in the Ballary stretch 
to symbolically connect with voters of Kalyana 
Karnataka (Hyderabad Karnataka) region, which sends 
about 40 MLAs to the state Assembly. 
Karnataka is the most crucial state for the Con- 
gress as it is hoping to wrest it from the ruling BJP 
in 2023 Assembly polls. In last one week’s paday- 
atra, Rahul Gandhi has been able strike the right 
chord with voters so far, as the state ruling BJP, 
under Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and BJP 
state Presdient Naleen Kumar Kateel, is mired in 
several controversies such as “40 per cent commis- 
sion government”, recent floods in Bengaluru and 
policy paralysis, often raised by top industrialists 
like former Infosys CEO Mohandas Pai and Biocon 
CEO Kiran Mazumdar that have blunt the BJP’s 
attack on Rahul Gandhi’s tour, even though the BJP’s 
social media wing is often struggling to outsmart the 
Congress party’s campaign strategies. For the first 
time, it appears that the Congress party campaign 
managers have succeeded in beating the BJP’s own 
game in social media.
 In Karnataka, the BJP failed even to find “Burburry 
T Shirt” moment to target Rahul Gandhi. Though 
the BJP tried to come out with its own communal 
narrative by releasing “PFI Bhgaya”  posters on 
similar lines of Congress party’s “Pay CM” cam- 
paign, it immediately fizzled out as the Congress 
party countered it, releasing CBI filing B report in 
famous Paresh Mesta case, which had helped BJP 
to weave communal narrative in 2023 Assembly 
polls and able to reap huge benefit in communally 
sensitive districts Shivamogga, Kodagu, Dakshin 
Kannada, Uttar Kannada, Udupi and Chikkmagalur

has so far succeeded in striking the right chord in 
delivering speech in heavy rains in Mandya or peel- 
ing sugarcane like a common man, images that have 
gone viral across the country. Rahul Gandhi has also 
succeeded in galvanising party workers across the 
state. Despite the support that Rahul Gandhi’s yatra 
succeeded to garner for the party, the Congress party’s 
internal squabbles  can “mess it up” as both Karna 
taka Pradesh Congress Committee president  D.K. 
Shivkumar and Congress Legislature Party leader 
Siddaramaiah are eyeing the Chief Minister’s post. 
The former Congress president’s Yatra would cover 
511 km passing through various districts in 21 days 
and Congress has been maintaining that party would 
speak more about the “pain of Karnataka”  rather than 
politics. Apart from corruption allegations, the party 
has also been questioning the government on the rise 
in prices of essential commodities, unemployment, 
farmers’ issues and communal unrest. The yatra will 
traverse through districts of Chamarajanagar, Mysuru, 
Mandya, Tumakuru, Chitradurga and Ballari.

It has been our history that 
emotions always override 
pragmatism in the matters 
of politics and elections. An 
Indian election is the greatest 
stage for political leaders of 
all ideologies to court their 
people on a variety of issues 
using emotional appeal and 
approach. Emotions have 
always played a vital role in 
Indian elections. The origin 
and growth of the Dravidian 
political parties are closely 
linked to the emotions over 
linguistic nationalism. The 
Bharatiya Janata Party’s 
rapid rise in national politics 
would not have been possible without the 
Ram Janmabhoomi movement. M.G. 
Ramachandran in Tamil 
Nadu and N.T. Rama Rao in 
Andhra Pradesh continue 
to live in the hearts of people 
there due to the emotional 
undertones in their politics. 
The sympathy wave that followed the assassinations of 
former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and 
Rajiv Gandhi helped the Congress win 
general elections in 1985 and 
1991.
Even in Kerala, emotional 
issues have cropped up 
where, normally, politics 
and elections were always 
fought on ideological and 
social issues. An allegedly 
fragile 116-year-old brim- 
ming dam, which has been a 
bone of contention between 
Kerala and Tamil Nadu for 
years, had become an 
explosive and sensitive political 
issue in the state. 
Emotions are powerful 
source which mobilize very 
fast in politics. They frame 
ideologies, build up opinions and can drive 
the specific agenda. It is observed 
that political campaigns 
recognise the centrality of 
emotions in shaping voter 
perceptions and strategi- 
cally leverage voters’ emotional vulnerabilities to 
perspective
in crucial KarnataKa
fulfil electoral goals. Keeping the power of emotion in 
mind, our political leaders 
focus on the interplay between ethics and emotions 
such as fear, hope, anxiety, 
anger, hatred, betrayal for 
electoral success. They also 
instigate voters on sensitive 
issues and go to the extreme 
stage to exploit voters’ emotions in many cases. 
Emotional exaggeration 
is harmful for any ecosystem, not just for politics. It 
can lower the credibility of 
a fraternity, an institution, 
a society or even a family. 
Repeated emotional exaggeration might diminish the 
system’s sensitivity. It might 
lead to decreased trust and 
dependability in those who 
exaggerate their emotions. 
Elections should be fought 
on issues of public welfare 
and development, not on 
emotions. Of course, our 
leaders talk about it but 
in practice, they flout the 
model code of conduct and 
polarise voters in the name 
of religion, caste and many 
kinds of emotional issues. 
We are the largest democracy in the world. Instead of 
developing and evolving to 
become more mature after 
75 years of independence, 
the democratic ideals are 
rapidly vanishing in our 
country. (Political parties 
should recognise that their 
organisations are intended 
to remain forever, while 
individuals may exist for 
a limited time. Promoting 
impolite political behaviour 
and reinventing politics for 
short-term political gains 
may do irreversible harm 
to not just their particular 
parties, but also to public 
discourse, state institutions, 
and the nation’s political 
ecology.)
This is now time to recognise and acknowledge the 
importance of emotional 
intelligence in everyday 
politics. 
Emotional intelligence refers to the ability to perceive, 
control, use, evaluate and
handle emotions. People 
with emotional intelligence 
can recognise their own 
emotions and those of others, use emotional informa- 
tion to guide thinking and 
behaviour, discern between 
different feelings and label 
them appropriately, and 
adjust emotions to adapt to 
environments. 
Unfortunately, in today’s 
politics of deception, exaggeration and hyperbole, 
emotional intelligence is 
the farthest thing one can 
anticipate from the present 
political scenario. 
Politics is a democratic 
institution, not dramatic 
platform. It enables self government via people’s 
representation; it is not 
a system that should be 
mocked on a regular basis to 
the point where it becomes 
an ugly comedy soap opera 
or a C-grade TV series.

The Supreme Court in 
the case Fertilizers 
and Chemicals Travancore Ltd. & Ors Versus 
Anusree K.B observed and 
discussed that how compassionate appointment 
in public services is an exception to 
the general rule of appointments and how it flows out 
of pure humanitarian consideration.
The bench comprising of 
Justice MR Shah and Justice 
Krishna Murari observed 
and stated that the purpose 
of compassionate appointment is to enable the family 
to tide over the sudden crisis, 
i.e., after the death of the sole 
bread-winner in the family. 
It was observed that as 
per the law laid down by 
this Court in the aforesaid 
decisions, compassionate 
appointment is an exception to the general rule of 
appointment in the public 
services and is in favour 
of the dependents of a deceased dying in harness and 
is leaving his family in penury and without any means 
of livelihood, in such cases, 
out of pure humanitarian 
consideration while taking 
into consideration the facts 
that unless some source of 
livelihood is provided, the 
family would not be able to 
make both ends meet and a 
provision has been made in 
the rules to provide gain- 
ful employment to one of 
the dependants of the deceased who may be eligible 
for such employment. Thus, 
the whole object of granting 
compassionate employment 
is to enable the family to tide 
over the sudden crisis occurred. However, the object 
is not to give such family a 
post much less a post held by 
the deceased.
Further, these pertinent 
observations came while 
the Bench was considering 
a civil appeal which challenged two orders of the 
Kerala High Court asking 
the appellant company to 
consider the respondent’s 
application for compassionate appointment. 
It was stated that after 14 
years after the respondent’s 
father’s death, the respondent applied for a job with 
the Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore Ltd. on the 
grounds of compassionate 
appointment. The application made by her was rejected as her name was not 
in the list of dependents 
submitted by the deceased 
employee.
Aggrieved with this, the 
respondent moved the 
High Court, which asked 
the appellant to consider 
her application. The same 
was disqualified, the appellants moved the a Division 
Bench of the High Court, 
which dismissed the appeal 
and this made appellants to 
move the Top Court.
The Counsel, Siddharth 
Jha appearing for the appellants argued that the High 
Court shouldn’t have entertained the respondent’s 
petition seeking compassionate appointment. However, 
for reconsidering the case 
of the respondent now for 
appointment on compassionate ground after 24 
years would be against the 
object and purpose of appointment on 
compassionate ground, i.e., to meet out 
the difficulties which is 
being created on account 
of sudden death of the sole 
bread earner.
The Counsel, Senior Advocate Sanjay Parikh 
appearing for the respondent 
submitted that when the 
deceased employee died in 
the year 1995, the respondent was minor and after 
attaining the age of majority, the respondent daughter 
made an application for the 
appointment on an compassionate ground. However, 
the respondent was called 
for an interview in 2018 and 
at that time the appointment 
was denied on the ground 
that in the dependent’s list, 
the name of the respondent 
is not mentioned, which 
is being found to be factu- 
ally incorrect. Thus, it was 
argued that the respondent 
cannot be denied the appointment on compassion- 
ate ground on the ground 
of delay
The Supreme Court after 
referring to various cases 
including the case N.C. Santhosh Vs. State of Karna- 
taka, wherein it was reiterated that the compassionate 
ground is a concession and 
not a right.
As per the Court, the respondent is not entitled the 
respondent entitled to the 
appointment on compassionate ground on the death 
of her father, who died in 
1995.
The bench observed that 
after a period of 24 years 
from the death of the deceased employee, 
the respondent shall not be entitled to the appointment 
on compassionate ground 
and if such an appointment 
is made now and or after 
a period of 14 to 24 years, 
the same shall be against 
the object and purpose for 
which the appointment on 
compassionate ground is 
provided.
Accordingly, the bench set 
aside the orders passed by 
the Single Judge as well as 
the Division Bench of the 
Kerala High Court.

The Delhi High Court in the case 
Freya Kothari v. Union of India & 
Ors observed and has dismissed 
a candidate’s plea challenging the 
final answer key issued by National 
Testing Agency (NTA) for National Eligibility 
cum Entrance Test (NEET) Undergraduate 
Examination, 2022. The court stated that it 
is not an expert in the field of 
medical science to sit over the decision 
of experts and substitute it with its 
own wisdom.
The bench comprising of Justice 
Amit Mahajan observed while 
noting that final answers are 
published after experts duly consider 
various objections raised by the 
candidates, the bench stated that 
there was no material on record 
for doubting the decision taken by 
such experts. On September 08, 
the final answer key for the exam 
held in July was issued.
The court while observing that 
scope of judicial review in such 
cases is limited, the questions asked 
for the candidates were tricky and 
their answers cannot be argued to 
be in a straitjacket formula.
The Court added that this court 
being not an expert in the field and 
cannot supplant its opinion being 
not in a position to interpret the 
medical literature and would be 
over-stepping its jurisdiction by 
holding the view which has been 
given by the experts to be an incorrect 
view. Thus, the answers given 
in the key cannot be patently called 
to be wrong on the face of it. 
Also, the court stated that the 
answers to the questions are 
debatable and therefore it is beyond the 
scope of the judicial review. 
Adding to it, it stated that the 
moment, the Court has to conduct the 
exercise wherein the arguments 
have to be heard on whether 
answer key is correct or incorrect, and 
it has to consider the arguments 
advanced by both the parties to 
reach a conclusion that itself would 
mean that answer selected by 
experts is not demonstrably wrong 
and would amount to interference 
which has been frowned upon in 
such cases by the Courts.
Freya Kothari, a candidate, had 
challenged the final answer key 
alleging that the answers provided 
therein in respect of four questions 
were incorrect. However, claiming 
that the answers given by her 
were correct, the candidate sought 
re-evaluation of the answer key 
and also to resultant marks for the 
questions.
It stated that Kothari, who got 
10497 general category rank in 
the merit list and 25628 in NEET 
All India rank, claimed that if the 
marks were correctly awarded, she 
would achieve a much higher rank. 
It was observed that it was her 
case her case that the answers given 
by her were based on the approved 
syllabus from NCERT Book which 
was also pointed out to NTA when 
she challenged provisional answer 
keys under the rules in August. 
The court while rejecting her 
plea observed that while one or 
two answers can look correct, the 
candidate has to choose the answer 
which experts feel to be the most 
appropriate one.
The Court stated that this itself 
leads to a situation where the 
correctness of the answer becomes a 
matter of debate and does not fall in 
the category of cases where it leaves 
no room for doubt that the answer 
given by the student are the correct 
answer.
Further, the court stated that 
it does not find that the answers 
provided in the answer key for the 
question Nos. 63, 127, 133 and 164 
are “such demonstrably wrong 
and incorrect” to fall within the 
parameters being set by the Supreme 
Court for judicial interference.

The Delhi High Court in the 
case Dhiraj Aggarwal v. UOI 
& Anr observed and has 
disposed of a Public Interest 
Litigation seeking a helpline 
for assistance of those registering for inoculation, while 
following the Centre’s submission that more than 200 
crore doses of COVID-19 
vaccine have been administered across the country. 
It was observed that a bedridden senior citizen 
had approached the court last year, 
stating she was at a high risk 
of getting exposed to the virus if she wishes to go out 
to the vaccination centre, it 
stated that she was suffering 
from arthritis. However, her 
PIL also prayed for framing 
of an urgent policy for door-to-door 
vaccination of super-senior and bed-ridden 
citizens in the national capital. 
In recent hearing, a central 
government told the court 
that the State has carried out 
door to door vaccination and 
more than 200 crore doses 
have been provided to the 
people across India. It was 
submitted by the counsel 
that no further orders are 
required to be passed in the 
PIL.
The division bench comprising of Chief Justice Satish 
Chandra Sharma and Justice 
Subramonium Prasad observed and stated that the 
learned counsel for the Petitioner was fair enough in 
stating before this Court that 
no further orders are called 
for in the present PIL filled 
keeping in view the massive 
vaccination drive initiated by 
Government of India in view 
of the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
Thus, the present PIL stand 
of disposed, in light of the 
aforesaid.
It had been argued in the 
PIL that many super-senior 
and bed-ridden citizens do 
not have the requisite facilities 
to get themselves registered 
on CoWin Application. 
Also, it was stated that many 
foreign countries like 
Singapore and Australia had a 
system of vaccinating old 
aged and bed ridden citizens 
at their home by sending a 
medical team.
The plea reads that because 
it is obligatory duty of the 
respondent no. I and 
respondent no. 2 to take care of bed 
ridden and super senior 
citizens so denying the vaccine 
by not introducing a helpline 
number for registration of 
COVID-19 vaccine and a 
policy on urgent basis for 
door-to-door covid-19 vaccination for bed ridden and 
super senior citizens in Delhi 
is against the fundamental 
right to life of a citizen.

The Mumbai bench of the Income 
Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) 
in the case DCIT Versus M/s. 
N.V.Developers Pvt. Ltd observed 
and has held that the income from 
operating and maintaining an IT 
park is to be assessed under the 
head “Income from Business”. 
The two-member bench of Judicial Member, Vikas Awasthy and 
the Accountant Member, M. Balaganesh observed and has stated 
that the income from letting out 
the premises/developing space 
along with other facilities in an industrial park, SEZ is to be charged 
to tax under the head “profits and 
gains of business.
The assessee/respondent is engaged in operating, developing 
and maintaining an information 
technology park (IT Park). An in come of 
Rs.11,83,86,181 has been received by the assessee from letting 
out, operating, and maintaining an 
IT park named G-Corp Tech Park 
and offered the same for tax under 
the head “Business Income”. 
It was observed by the Assessing Officer did not concur with 
the assessee’s claim with respect to 
income from IT Park as “Business 
Income”. It was held by the Assessing 
Officer that the rental income 
from IT Park is assessable under the 
head “Income from House Property. 
Thus, the assessee was aggrieved by 
the assessment order and appealed 
before the CIT(A), assailing the findings 
of the Assessing Officer in treating 
the income from maintaining 
and operating G-Corp Tech Park as 
the income from “house property”. 
It was observed that the CIT (A), 
after considering the facts and 
various decisions, reversed the findings 
of the Assessing Officer and held 
that the receipts from the operation and maintenance of G-Corp 
Tech Park are to be assessed under 
the head of “Income from Business”. 
In the present case, the issue raised 
was whether rental income received
by the assessee from the Information 
Technology Park was to be 
assessed as “Income from House 
Property” or “Income from Business”.
It was vehemently defended by the 
department that the assessment order and 
prayed for the reversal of 
the findings of CIT(A) and upheld 
the findings of the Assessing Officer. 
It was contended by the assessee 
that the main objectives of the assessee 
company are to develop and 
operate technological parks, software parks, 
electronic and hardware technology parks, etc. It was 
refered by the assessee to CBDT 
Circular No.16/2017 dated April 25, 
2017 to contend that lease rent from 
letting out the building and developing 
space along with amenities in 
an SEZ or industrial park is to be 
considered as “business income”. 
It was noted by the tribunal that no 
material has been placed on record 
to show that any appeal was filed 
by the Revenue against the order of 
CIT(A) for Assessment Year 2011-12 
or Assessment Year 2013-14. 
Accordingly, the tribunal dismissed the 
appeal of the department, while following the principle 
of consistency.

Climate change has emerged 
as one of the pressing issues 
of the 21st century. Climate 
change is like a pandemic, it 
does not spare even the most 
advanced countries. Weather and climatic extremes are 
becoming more common as 
a result of human caused 
climate change across the 
world. Acute occurrences 
of storms, droughts, floods, 
cyclical fluctuations in precipitation and long-term 
variations in temperature 
and sea levels, are all made 
more likely by climate 
change. This will result in 
deaths, injuries, and poor 
health related diseases, as 
well as damage to infrastructure, livelihoods and 
natural resources. Marginalised 
communities who live in old 
and substandard houses 
and have limited resources 
are especially susceptible 
to floods and cyclones. Approximately 40% of the 
world’s population now lives 
within 100 km of a coastline 
and 100 m of sea level. it is 
anticipated that by 2030 half 
of the world’s population 
would reside in coastal areas. As per the World Bank 
study (2018), climate change 
will relocate 143 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, 
Latin America, and south 
Asia. Climate proofing the 
houses and infrastructure 
for all is a necessity.
clImate change 
and vulnerabIlIty 
of IndIa’s coastal 
Infrastructure
India is one of the most 
vulnerable countries to the 
effects of climate change 
and simultaneously suf- 
fers from endemic levels 
of poverty. In recent years, 
India has experienced an 
increase in the severity and 
frequency of weather events 
and climate-related natural 
disasters.India is the third- 
worst-affected country due 
to the climatic disasters. In 
India 170 million people live 
in the coastal regions. According to the Internal Dis- 
placement Monitoring Centre, between 2008 and 2018, 
over 3.6 million Indians were 
moved every year, the majority as a result of monsoon 
rains, which are the heaviest in South Asia. As per the 
report Human Cost of Disasters (2000-2019) published 
by the United Nations Office 
for Disaster Risk Reduction, 
India has the third highest 
number of disaster events. 
It is also the second most 
impacted country by floods 
with 345 million people affected. Extreme cyclones 
namely the recent Yaas, Amphan, Fani, Gaja, 
and Hudhud, as well as catastrophic 
floods, have wreaked havoc 
on its coastal states of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil 
Nadu, and Kerala. The man grove ecosystem, which acts 
as a natural barrier against 
cyclones and coastal erosion in coastal areas, has 
been badly harmed and 
is expected to be further 
harmed as an outcome of 
climate change. According 
to estimates from the Central 
Water Commission, the total 
damage from climate-related 
extreme weather events on 
infrastructure and housing 
is more than INR 36 million, 
or 3% of India’s GDP.
The major cyclone Fani 
hit Odisha with a population of around 46 million 
people, in May 2019. State 
authorities used an effective early-warning system to 
evacuate 1.2 million people 
in 24 hours, making it one 
of the largest evacuations in 
history and earning praise 
from the United Nations. 
With the increasing effects 
of climate change, tens of 
thousands more people 
may be forced to migrate or 
be displaced from high-risk 
areas along the Indian coast. 
Many families may be forced 
to relocate within their own 
state or further afield to 
avoid the effects of sea level 
rise and coastal inundation if 
concrete climate and development action is not taken. 
It is imperative that climate 
resilient infrastructure and 
houses are built which are 
affordable, safe and ad- 
equate which could benefit 
the people living in poverty.
safeguardIng future prosperIty
Acknowledging the effects 
of climate change on our 
lives and directing all our resources and efforts towards 
the attainment of climate 
resilience is important. Climate resilience refers to the 
ability to predict, prepare 
exPorts
for, and assess how climate 
change can create hazardous events and take steps to 
cope with such events. Adaptation to climate change 
for people living in coastal 
areas is a necessity. Infrastructure that is both acces- 
sible and functional is critical to human well-being and 
economic progress. People 
living in coastal areas are 
vulnerable to triple threats 
which are limited resources 
for affordable housing infrastructure, socioeconomic 
vulnerability, and increased 
flooding due to sea level rise.
analysIs
As climatic conditions worsens and extreme weather 
events like floods, storms 
and cyclones are becoming normal in the 
climate constrained weather. To 
maintain the global average 
temperature below the Paris 
Agreement’s 1.5 degree safe 
limit, collaborative action 
and funding is required. 
Government and Non Governmental Organisation 
should come together to take 
preventive measures which 
would ultimately reduce disaster risks and 
post recovery losses. It is imperative 
to invest in making climate 
resilient housing for the people. 
There is a huge requirement of funds which can 
be solved if the government 
incentivises private investors 
to enter into the long term 
contracts with Development 
Financial Institutions to 
work on innovative and sustainable houses for 
the marginalised communities. If 
appropriately managed, relocating communities from 
hazard prone places can be a 
valuable adaptation strategy 
for providing alternatives to 
physical protection. However, there is a need for more 
forward looking sustainable 
housing planning to protect 
the people living in coastal 
areas who are vulnerable. Sensitising and raising 
awareness amongst the people about the benefits 
of climate resilient houses is also 
a significant component for 
the planning. Furthermore, 
strong community demand 
and community support can 
lead to decision-makers and 
planners reaching a consensus. Currently, 
India’s construction industry is altering 
its building processes in order to minimise greenhouse 
gas emissions and make sustainable 
buildings more accessible to individuals with 
limited financial resources. 
Failure to do so sufficiently 
will put marginalised communities in more danger in 
the future.

In Sugar Season (Oct-Sep) 2021-22, 
a record of more than 5000 Lakh 
Metric Tons (LMT) sugarcane was 
produced in the country out of 
which about 3574 LMT of sugarcane 
was crushed by sugar mills to 
produce about 394 LMT of sugar 
(Sucrose). Out of this, 35 LMT 
sugar was diverted to ethanol 
production and 359 LMT sugar was 
produced by sugar mills. With this, 
India has emerged as the world’s 
largest producer and consumer 
of sugar as well as the world’s 2nd 
largest exporter of sugar.
The season has proven to be a 
watershed season for Indian Sugar 
Sector. All records of sugarcane 
production, sugar production, 
sugar exports, cane procured, cane 
dues paid and ethanol production 
were made during the season. 
Another shining highlight of 
the season is the highest exports 
of about 109.8 LMT that too with 
no financial assistance which was 
being extended upto 2020-21. 
Supportive international prices and 
Indian Government Policy led to 
this feat of Indian Sugar Industry. 
These exports earned foreign 
currency of about Rs. 40,000 crores 
for the country.
The success story of sugar industry 
is the outcome of synchronous 
and collaborative efforts of Central 
and State Governments, farmers, 
sugar mills, ethanol distilleries 
with very supportive overall ecosystem 
for business in the country. 
Timely Government interventions 
since last 5 years have been crucial 
in building the sugar sector step by 
step from taking them out of financial 
distress in 2018-19 to the stage 
of self sufficiency in 2021-22. 
During SS 2021-22, sugar mills 
procured sugarcane worth more 
than 1.18 lakh crore and released 
payment of more than 1.12 lakh 
crore with no financial assistance 
(subsidy) from Government of India. 
Thus, cane dues at the end of 
sugar season are less than ₹ 6,000 
crore indicating that 95% of cane 
dues have already been cleared. It 
is also noteworthy that for SS 2020-21, 
more than 99.9% cane dues are 
cleared.
Government has been encouraging 
sugar mills to divert sugar to 
ethanol and also to export surplus 
sugar so that sugar mills may make 
payment of cane dues to farmers in 
time and also mills may have better 
financial conditions to continue 
their operations.
Growth of ethanol as biofuel 
sector in last 5 years has amply 
supported the sugar sector as use of 
sugar to ethanol has led to better 
financial positions of sugar mills 
due to faster payments, reduced 
working capital requirements and 
less blockage of funds due to less 
surplus sugar with mills. During 
2021-22, revenue of about ₹ 18,000 
crore has been made by sugar 
mills/distilleries from sale of 
ethanol which has also played its role 
in early clearance of cane dues of 
farmers. Ethanol production 
capacity of molasses/sugar-based 
distilleries has increased to 605 crore 
litres per annum and the progress 
is still continuing to meet targets 
of 20% blending by 2025 under 
Ethanol Blending with Petrol 
(EBP) Programme. In new season, 
the diversion of sugar to ethanol is 
expected to increase from 35 LMT 
to 50 LMT which would generate 
revenue for sugar mills amounting 
to about ₹ 25,000 crores.
There is an optimum closing 
balance of 60 LMT of sugar which 
is essential to meet domestic 
requirements for 2.5 months. The 
diversion of sugar to ethanol and 
exports led to unlocking of value 
chain of the whole industry as well 
as improved financial conditions 
of sugar mills leading to more optional mills in ensuing season.

Underscoring that 
the US will never 
recognise Russia’s purported annexation of Ukrainian territory, 
US President Joe Biden on 
Tuesday (local time) announced plans to provide 
an additional USD 625 
million in military aid to 
Ukraine. 
According to a White 
House statement, US President Joe Biden and Vice

spoke today with President 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy of 
Ukraine to underscore that 
the United States will never 
recognise Russia’s purportnaVal poWer

territory,” the statement 
read. Biden also provided 
details on the latest package, 
which includes High Mobility Artillery Rocket 
Systems, or HIMARS, artillery 
systems ammunition, and 
armoured vehicles. 
“President Biden pledged 
to continue supporting 
Ukraine as it defends itself 
from Russian aggression for 
as long as it takes, includ- 
ing the provision today of a 
new $625 million security 
assistance package that includes additional weapons

He also affirmed the continued readiness of the US 
to impose severe costs on 
any individual, entity, or 
country that provides support to Russia’s purported 
annexation. 
Biden further welcomed 
he success of the agreement 
that has allowed the safe 
export of Ukrainian grain 
to global markets and emphasised the need to ensure 
that continues. In addition, 
President Biden noted the 
ongoing efforts of the United States to rally the world 
behind Ukraine’s efforts 
to defend its freedom and 
democracy, as enshrined in 
the United Nations Charter, as per the White House

Pakistan is entangled in 
yet another controversy as 
Islamabad has been found 
supplying arms and ammunition to Kyiv in the ongoing 
Russia-Ukraine war.
As per reports, Pakistan is 
not impartial in the ongoing 
Russia-Ukraine conflict and 
has been involved in supplying arms and ammunition, 
made in Pakistan, for the 
end use of Ukraine. Islamabad is apparently utilising 
third-country-based defence 
suppliers and contractors to 
route these defence sales to 
Ukraine, reported Europe- 
based publication Geopolitik. Credible inputs suggest 
that Islamabad-based arms 
supplier M/s DMI Associates has been in contact with 
Bulgaria-based firm M/s 
Defence Industry Group to 
facilitate the supply of manufactured defence stores to the 
Ukrainian government. 
Separately, a Slovakia based defence company M/s 
Chemica had reportedly 
approached M/s Kestral, a 
defence supplier of ammu- 
nition of Pak Ordinance Factories, on behalf of Ukraine’s 
Defence Ministry, reported 
Geo-politik.
M/s Kestral may be using 
the conflict to spread its activities in countries adjacent 
to Ukraine, namely Poland, 
Romania and Slovakia, as 
the CEO of Kestral, Liaqat 
Ali Beg, visited these countries in May and June this 
year. 
In another such development, Kyiv-based Ukrainian 
company M/s FORMAG was 
learnt to have approached 
Pakistan-based M/s Bluelines Cargo Pvt Ltd to ship 
gloves meant for use by the 
Ukrainian army.
A recent report published

The United States and South 
Korea launched four missiles 
off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula 
on Wednesday morning, in response to 
North Korea’s provocative 
test launch of a ballistic missile over Japan. 
This test was the allies’ 
second exercise within 24 
hours, following North Korea’s launch of a ballistic 
missile over Japan on Tuesday morning. 
Earlier, on Tuesday, the 
US and South Korea initially responded to the launch 
with a precision bombing 
exercise, which involved a 
South Korean F-15K fighter 
jet firing two air-to-surface 
munitions at a virtual target 
in a firing range west of the 
Korean Peninsula, per the 
South Korean joint chiefs. 
“Through the combined 
flight of the air strike package and precision strike 
drills, South Korea and the 
United States demonstrated 
their will to respond sternly 
to any Northern threats as 
well as their capability to 
conduct a precision strike 
at the origin of provocations 
based on the alliance’s overwhelming forces,” the JCS 
said in a press release. 
The allies typically respond to missile tests by 
North Korea with military 
exercises.
citing South Korean joint 
chiefs, in Wednesday’s 
launch, four ATACMS 
(Army Tactical Missile Systems) missiles were involved. 
The ATACMS are surface to surface missiles that can 
fly around 200 miles (320 
kilometres). 
According to John Kirby, 
the National Security Council coordinator for strategic 
communications, the launch 
was designed to demonstrate that the US and its 
allies have “the military 
capabilities at the ready to 
respond to provocations by 
the North.” 
“This is not the first time 
we’ve done this in response 
to provocations by the North 
to make sure that we can 
demonstrate our own capabilities,” Kirby said.

Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has accused former 
premier Imran Khan of being the biggest liar on the face of 
the earth, alleging that the PTI chief has ruined the country’s 
economy. 
Shehbaz Sharif spoke about the “damage” that the Pakistan 
Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman had done to Pakistan’s 
domestic and foreign affairs. Addressing Imran Khan’s recent 
alleged cypher audio leaks, the Prime Minister said that they 
were “an irrefutable endorsement that he (Imran) is the biggest 
liar on the face of the earth”. 
The cypher is an alleged secret diplomatic cable which 
fueled conspiracy theories that the US administration wanted to 
topple Imran Khan’s government and facilitate regime change 
in the country. 
The cypher is based on then envoy Asad Majeed’s meeting 
with US State Department official Donald Lu, who has been 
at the centre of PTI’s claim that the US conspired to dislodge 
Imran from office in April. 
“I’m not saying this with a sense of glee but a sense of embar- 
rassment and concern. Sharif added in an interview with the 
British newspaper Dawn. 
He accused Imran Khan of “injecting poison into society to 
dangerously polarise the electorate” since his ouster through 
a successful no-confidence vote in April. In his first interview 
with the outlet since he became Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif 
termed the PTI chief as a “liar and a cheat”, alleging that his 
policies had left the economy in “ruins”. 
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said in its latest 
report that Pakistan’s economy is forecast to slow by 3.5% in 
the financial year 2022–23 due to reasons like devastating 
floods and policy tightening.

Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa 
assured the nation on Tuesday 
that the armed forces have 
distanced themselves from 
politics and want to stay 
away from it in the future as 
well. While addressing the 
gathering during the lunch 
at Pakistani Embassy in 
Washington, Pakistan Bajwa said that he will leave 
after the completion of his 
second three-year term in 
two months, Dawn reported. He reminded the nation 
that reviving the country’s 
ailing economy should be 
the first priority of all segments of society, adding that 
without a strong economy 
the nation would not be able 
to achieve its targets.
“There could be no diplomacy either without a 
strong economy,” said the 
army chief in his address to 
an audience which included 
a large number of Pakistani 
diplomats. After lunch, Bajwa went to the Pentagon for 
a meeting with US Defence 
Secretary Lloyd Austin. 
According to Dawn citing 
Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Bajwa called 
on retired General Lloyd 
James Austin III, Secretary 
of Defence; Jacob Jeremiah 
Sullivan, National Security 
Adviser; and Wendy Ruth 
Sherman, Deputy Secretary 
of State. During the meetings, 
matters of mutual of 
interest, regional security 
situations and bilateral cooperation in various fields 
were discussed. 
The army chief thanked 
the US officials for their 
support and reiterated that 
assistance from “our global 
partners shall be vital for 
rescue/rehabilitation of the 
flood victims in Pakistan”, 
as reported by Dawn. 
US had provided $56.5 
million in aid to Pakistan 
for flood relief and humanitarian assistance this year. 
During his meeting with 
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister 
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, US 
Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken had expressed his 
sorrow over the devastation 
and loss of life throughout 
the country caused by catastrophic flooding. 
“He reaffirmed the US 
commitment to the people 
of Pakistan, noting the 
nearly USD 56.5 million in 
flood relief and humanitarian assistance provided 
this year as well as the additional USD 10 million of 
food security assistance 
announced today,” read the

Global criticism of China’s indifference to human rights 
finally seems to have forced President Xi Jinping to pay serious 
attention, but in his own way. 
He tells his people that China has its own individual 
approach to human rights that needs to be publicised and 
respected. Xi, in principle, formats human rights in the mould 
of Chinese characteristics as he decides to counter the 
criticism over the treatment of Uyghur Muslims by refusing to 
be apologetic about it. The change in the communist 
leadership’s human rights approach on the eve of Xi’s third term of 
power at the 20th party congress later in October is 
recognised in Xi’s address to the 37th group study session of the 
Chinese Communist Party’s central committee, held earlier 
this year. 
He takes credit for having taken the protection of human 
rights to a higher level after he came to power in 2012. 
Significantly, he talks of social, political, and economic goals 
for ensuring human rights but ignores to mention how his 
government pursues a merciless form of sinicization of Islam 
to destroy the cultural and religious roots of minority 
communities of China, especially Uyghur Muslims. In his long 
address, he mentions religious beliefs only in passing. That 
gives him away. 
The goals of this session were to review our country’s 
human rights achievements, both theoretical and practical, in 
the new era; assess the international struggle in the sphere of 
human rights; and “maintain a steadfast commitment to the 
Chinese path to promote further progress in human rights.

As Pakistan always 
cries for funding in 
the name of development and disaster man- 
agement, the so called defence sector of the country 
continues to enjoy grants, 
subsidies and loans despite 
the financial crunches. 
A Canada-based think 
tank International Forum 
for Rights and Security (IFFRAS), has highlighted the 
freebies to the elite military 
of the country. According to 
it, defence and debt servicing 
make up about 58 per cent 
of the budget for 2022-23, 
which is an increase of 24.3 
per cent over the previous 
year.
While the funds for development expenditure 
have been cut in Pakistan 
and subsidies withdrawn 
for items like petroleum 
products and electricity, the 
defence sector continues to 
enjoy grants, subsidies and 
loan write-offs to the tune of 
PKR116 million in the current fiscal year.
The Pakistani Armed Forces also generate additional 
sources of income through 
their public sector enterprises and their business 
welfare models. These have 
been traditionally exempted 
Islamabad
from excise and taxation, as 
per the think tank. 
Report says that in 2021-22 
alone, PKR26 billion (USO 
110 million) worth of tax 
exemptions were given to 
military-managed business 
entities. Apart from these 
direct expenditures, a large 
number of military related 
requirements are cross subsidized and met through 
funds allocated to other 
ministries. IFFRAS reported that 
Pakistan which has been 
continuously plunging 
from one economic crisis 
to another, the deliberate 
opaqueness built into the 
defence expenditure needs 
to be addressed holistically 
to ensure economic security. 
At present, Pakistan has 
been witnessing the devastating floods which impacted 
the country’s economic situation.

Danish Queen Margrethe II 
apologized for stripping four 
of her eight grandchildren of 
their royal titles.
The queen said that she 
was ‘sorry’ for stripping 
her grandchildren of royal 
titles. However, she is not 
changing her mind about 
the move. The 82-year-old 
monarch announced in late 
September that the children 
of her younger son, Prince 
Joachim, would no longer be 
known as prince and princess from next year. 
Instead, they will only 
be able to use their titles of 
count and countess of Monpezat and will be addressed 
as excellencies, as their HRH 
titles will be “discontinued,” 
according to the royal household. Helle von Wildenrath 
Lovgreen, press secretary to 
Countess Alexandra, the former wife of Prince Joachim, 
said that Joachim and his 
children were “sad” and 
“shocked” by the decision, 
which Queen Margrethe 
views “as a necessary future 
proofing of the monarchy,” 
according to a statement 
from the Queen.
“In recent days, there have 
been strong reactions to my 
decision about the future use 
of titles for Prince Joachim’s 
four children.
 “That affects me, of 
course,” the monarch said 
in the statement. “My decision has been a long time 
coming. With my 50 years 
Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.
on the throne, it is natural 
both to look back and to look 
ahead. It is my duty and my 
desire as Queen to ensure 
that the monarchy always 
shapes itself in keeping with 
the times. Sometimes, this 
means that difficult decisions must be made, and it 
will always be difficult to 
find the right moment,” she 
added.
The Queen said that she 
made the “adjustment” to 
allow the junior royals to 
lead more normal lives, 
while following a similar 
decision by other royal families to slim down the monarchy. 
“Holding a royal title involves a number 
of commitments and duties that, in the 
future, will lie with fewer 
members of the royal family,” she said.
Crown Prince Frederik, 
the Queen’s older son, is 
first in line to the throne. 
His oldest child, Prince 
Christian, is second in line. 
All four of Frederik’s 
children retain their titles. 
‘click chemistry’
His younger brother, 
Joachim, lives in Paris with 
his wife Princess Marie, and 
has two children, Henrik, 
13, and Athena, 10. 
The prince also has two 
older sons, Nikolai, 23, 
and Felix, 20, from his first 
marriage to Alexandra, the 
Countess of Frederiksborg. 
While Joachim’s children 
will lose their royal titles, 
they will maintain their 
places in the order of succession.
The monarch said, “I have 
made my decision as Queen, 
mother, and grandmother, 
but, as a mother and grandmother, I have underesti- 
mated the extent to which 
much my younger son and 
his family feel affected. 
That makes a big impression, and for that I am sorry.” 
She added, “No one should 
be in doubt that my children, daughters-in-law, and 
grandchildren are my great 
joy and pride. I now hope 
that we as a family can find 
the peace to find our way 
through this situation.

Twitter on Tuesday (local

CEO Elon Musk sent a letter 
saying he will go through the 
deal he signed early this year 
to buy the platform for USD 
44 billion.
“Twitter issued this statement about today’s news: 
We received the letter from 
the Musk parties which they 
have filed with the SEC. The 
intention of the Company 
is to close the transaction 
at $54.20 per share,” the 
official account of Twitter 
Investor Relations wrote. 
After the news broke, that 
the billionaire is proposing to continue with USD 
54.20 per share to buy social 
media platforms, Twitter’s 
share price increased to 
12.7 per cent before trading 
was stopped for the second 
time. On the contrary, Tesla’s 
shares dropped by about 
3 per cent. Musk has been 
locked in a bitter legal battle 
with Twitter since announcing in July this year that he 
was pulling the plug on his 
USD 44 billion purchase 
of the company following a 
complex, and months long 
courtship.
Musk had cancelled the 
deal, claiming that he was 
misled by Twitter concerning the number of bot 
accounts on its platform. These 
allegations were forthrightly 
rejected by the company. The 
latest report on the Twitter 
buyout deal comes ahead of 
the Delaware Court hearing 
on 17 October, where the two 
sides are expected to clash 
over the multi-billion dollar 
buyout deal. Earlier, Twitter 
had sought an order directing Tesla CEO to complete 
deal at $54.20 per share.

Ussehra, or Vijayadashami, as many 
call it, is one of the 
most important festivals in 
India. In the northern Indian 
states, it’s called Dussehra, 
while in West Bengal, it’s 
called Vijayadashami. 
Dusshera falls on the tenth 
day of Sharada Navratri. 
However, despite the fact 
that celebrations and cultural practices vary 
according to the location in India’s 
culturally rich country, the 
festival’s fabric that binds 
everyone together remains.
Dussehra symbolises the 
triumph of good over evil, 
and it is tied to two stories. 
After a fierce battle that 
lasted more than nine days, 
it is said that Maa Durga 
conquered Mahishasura on this 
day. According to another 
tale, Dussehra is observed to 
commemorate Lord Rama’s 
victory over Lanka’s tenheaded evil king, Ravana.
significance
The tenth day of Navratri, 
which is comprised of nine 
days dedicated to honouring 
each form of Goddess Durga, 
is Dussehra. Vijayadashami, 
on the other hand, is the day 
of victory. While some connect 
it to the famous Ramayana conflict, others do it to 
remember Goddess Durga’s 
triumph over the demonic 
Mahishasura.
In some regions of the 
country, Dussehra, also 
known as Vijayadashami or 
Dasain, makes way for the 
Diwali celebrations. 
Twenty days after Dussehra, one of the 
most significant and widely celebrated 
festivals, the festival of lights, 
Diwali, commemorates Lord 
Rama’s return home following his victory over Ravana. 
However, the main message 
of the Dussehra festival is 
that of good triumphing over 
evil, and it is on this day that 
people pray for prosperity 
and good health.
celeBRations
The nine days of Navratri 
culminate in the killing of 
Ravana and the burning 
of his life-size effigy at the 
Ramlila, together with those 
of Meghnad and Kumbhakaran, 
on the day of Dussehra, or Vijayadashami, when 
the holiday is celebrated 
with great grandeur.
As each of Ravana’s heads 
represents a different negative attribute, Dussehra also 
represents purging oneself 
of sins or undesirable traits. 
In several southern Indian states, Shami Puja is 
also known as Banni Puja 
and Jammi Puja. Devotees 
wish Maa Durga farewell 
on Dashami, and the visarjan is performed either at 
Aparahna time or Pratahkala while Dashami Tithi is 
in effect.
The tenth day is also 
known as Vijayadashmi, 
when Maa Durga’s idol is 
submerged in water in the 
hopes that she will keep an 
eye on them and fend off all 
misfortunes and evils. Vijayadashmi and Dussehra 
commemorate the triumph 
of good over evil, and worshippers celebrate 
the festivals by indulging in various 
foods with their loved ones.

*
Every year, Dussehra is celebrated to 
commemorate the triumph of good 
over evil as Lord Rama killed Ravana 
on this day. The festival is celebrated in 
full swing across the country by burning 
the effigies of Ravan, Kumbhkaran, 
and Meghnath.
After a hiatus of a few years, the effigy 
business is getting back on track. 
Earlier, Naveen, a local artisan from 
Titarpur in New Delhi, revealed, “People 
are coming back in huge numbers 
to book Ravan effigies. Due to Covid, 
during the past few years, the business 
was not so good, but things are getting 
better now and customers are back. But 
now, the rates of effigies are a bit higher 
as compared to previous times. Now 
it costs Rs 500 per foot. We began the 
preparation two months ahead of the 
festival and we start the deliveries two 
days before Dussehra.”
“During Covid, Ravan idols were 
made in fewer numbers. We used to 
create only small mannequins of 5 feet 
and 10 feet for the common people, who 
could burn those effigies on the streets. 
But this year, the situation is quite different. 
We are celebrating every festival 
and the effigy business is also going 
really well. The craze among the people 
for Dussehra is very high. We are flooded 
with bookings this year. This year, 
we will see a good hike in sales. We have 
been working day and night for the past 
two months to create these effigies. We 
create effigies from five feet to fifty feet 
and the pricing begins from Rs 500 per 
foot, “Sonu, a local artist said.
On being asked whether the firecracker 
ban has affected the sales in Delhi or 
not, Naveen said, “No, it doesn’t matter. 
We only construct the effigies. It’s the 
customer’s choice to put firecrackers in 
them or not. They do it by themselves. 
People opt for eco-friendly firecrackers 
to create less pollution during Dussehra. “
Effigy maker Poonam said, “Yes, we 
are facing a big loss due to the fire- 
cracker ban by the Aam Aadmi Party 
in Delhi. Every year, CM Kejriwal puts a 
ban on firecrackers. During Diwali, 
everyone bursts crackers, but only during 
Dussehra, he puts a ban on them. We 
don’t put crackers in the effigies; people 
bring them and put them on their own. 
a huge downfall in the number of clients. 
Mostly, the customers cancel their 
already booked orders due to the ban. If 
the government doesn’t want us to do 
our business, then simply tell us. We 
don’t want to face loss at the last moment. “
“The number of firecrackers has now 
been reduced from 500 to 300 by CM 
Kejriwal. We don’t put crackers in the 
mannequins; that’s the customer’s call 
whether to put crackers or not,” said 
Mahendra Karari, Ravan effigy creator. 
Apart from making effigies during the 
festive season, local vendors indulge in 
their different businesses for the rest of 
the year for their source of income. 
“Dussehra festival comes once a year, 
and we have our other source of income 
as well. I am a driver for the whole year. 
But during Dussehra, I have made Ravan since my childhood in Titarpur, 
said Naveen.
Karari said, “We work in the hotel line 
during the whole year, and some of us 
work in brass bands during the marriage season, and some people work at 
local sweet shops.”
In some regions, the celebration, also 
known as Vijayadashami, celebrates 
Goddess Durga’s triumph over the buffalo Demon Mahishasura.

In commemoration of ‘100 
years of Bollywood’, a live 
audio-visual musical journey of songs from 1913 to 
2013, covering songs from 
Raja Harishchandra to Yeh 
Jawani Hai Deewani, from 
Prithviraj Kapoor to Ranbir 
Kapoor, from Saigal to Sonu 
Nigam, will be held. The 
event, which will also be a 
fundraiser, will be organised by Gunjan Foundation 
at Kamani Auditorium, Copernicus Marg, at 06:30 p.m 
on 10 October, 2022.  The 
proceeds from this show will 
go towards the education of 
underprivileged children, 
for the foundation expects all 
children in the community to 
learn and experience school 
education.
Sushma Singhvi founded 
the Gunjan Foundation, a 
non-governmental social 
organization, in 2004 with 
the mission of pursuing educational and other welfare 
measures to uplift marginalised sections of society. 
The Gunjan Foundation is 
providing full scholarships 
to about 200 school students. It has now widened 
its horizons further. Its vision also includes 
continuing to support advanced 
and professional courses in 
the future. For the past five 
years, Gunjan has been financially supporting four to 
five marginalised students 
who are pursuing such advanced and professional 
courses. This year, Gunjan 
Foundation’s first batch has 
passed out from the 12th 
grade, ready to embrace the 
growth opportunities of the 
world. Not wanting to leave 
these students midstream, it 
is also Gunjan’s endeavour 
now to see these students 
through college. The Gunjan 
Foundation is planning to 
provide scholarships to 
deserving students for higher 
studies.

A 136 ft tall puja pandal in 
the capital of Uttar Pradesh 
is going to attract everyone’s 
attention. The Durga Puja 
pandal, situated in Jankipuram, Lucknow, is going to 
be recorded in the Guinness 
Book of World Records as 
the tallest ever.
The pandal is a replica 
of the under construction 
Chandrodaya temple of 
Vrindavan, which is built to 
be one of the tallest religious 
monuments in the world 
with a height of above 700 ft 
and spread over a 5,40,000 
sq ft area.
The pandal stands tall in 
the middle of Durga Puja 
Park in Jankipuram. It was 
built by the Utsav Puja Com- 
mittee, which has also been 
celebrating the Puja for the 
last 28 years.
While emphasising the 
features of this tallest pandal, Rakesh Pandey, General 
Secretary of the Durga Puja 
committee, said,  “This entire 
pandal has been built by 52 
artisans from Kolkata and 
Assam and a time of over 
one month has been taken 
to build this tallest pandal.” 
“A total of Rs 32 lakhs has 
been spent on making this 
tallest Durga Puja pandal. 
Every day about 70 thousand devotees come to the 
pandal to offer their prayers 
to Durga Maa”, Rakesh Pandey said further.

Mercedes-Benz 
has launched the 
‘Made in India’ 
EQS 580 4MATIC in the 
market, a car that marks 
some significant firsts in 
India both for the German 
Luxury brand as well as the 
overall EV luxury space in 
our country. India becomes 
the first market outside of 
Germany to manufacture 
this luxury EV, which can 
also be dubbed as the S-Class 
of electric cars.
The EQS also becomes India’s longest-range EV with a 
range of 857 kms on a single 
charge, a number verified by 
Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI). The 
car has been priced at Rs. 
1.55 crore, ex-showroom.
Design
According to Mercedes, 
the EQS is the world’s most 
aerodynamic car and boasts 
of a drag coefficient from 
0.20. Streamlining, seam 
sealing and minimization, 
wheel design, tyre spoilers, 
underbody panelling, a rear 
lip spoiler, and self-lowering 
air suspension ensure better comfort, stable handling, 
driving range and efficiency. 
The doors are frameless, 
something that always adds 
to the premium quotient of 
a luxury car. Mercedes says 
that the fact that the EQS 
is based on an all-electric 
architecture also opened 
new design possibilities. As 
there is no large engine block 
on board, the behaviour in a 
frontal crash could be modelled even better. 
interiors
The sustainability in the 
EQS is enhanced through 
recycled & renewable raw 
materials as well as usage of 
recycled steel among other 
elements. One of the standout features in the cabin is 
indeed big 56-inch MBUX 
Hyperscreen. 
This includes the digital 
cluster, touchscreen system 
as well as a secondary 
screen for the front passenger. In addition, this the car 
also comes with a headup 
display and a Burmester 
surround sound system 
comprises 15 speakers with 
a total output of 710 watts.
Drive
The high-power density 
of the lithium-ion battery 
comes with usable energy 
content of 107.8 kWh and 
is equipped with a powerful 
400-volt battery manufactured using the lithium-ion 
technology. 
Maximum output generated is 385 kW while you get 
a peak torque figure of 855 
Nm. Remember this is an 
electric car so all that torque 
is available right from the 
word go. Because of this 
car accelerates from 0-100 
km/h in mere 4.3 seconds 
and reaches a maximum 
speed of 210 km/h. The big 
talking point is of course the 
range. 
At 857 kms on a single 
charge, the EQS has become 
the EV with the maximum 
range being sold currently 
in India.
The inclusion of rear-axle 
steering with 10° steering 
angle adjustment is a feature 
that works well looking at 
the congested Indian roads, 
tight parking spaces as well 
as the size of this luxury saloon. 
You also get to choose between Eco, Comfort, Sport 
and Individual drive modes
which change the accelerator 
pedal characteristic and agility, among other things.
In the Eco mode, the focus 
is on efficiency and an energy-efficient driving style. 
The car also gets a predictive route planning feature 
where the car plans the 
fastest and most convenient 
route, including charging 
stops, based on numerous 
factors and reacts dynamically to traffic jams or a 
change in driving style.
safety
The EQS comes with a 
EURO NCAP rating of 5 
star and gets as many as 9 
airbags. 
In addition to driver and 
front passenger airbags, a 
knee airbag on the driver’s 
side is also standard. It protects the legs from contact 
with the steering column or 
instrument panel in a severe 
frontal crash. It also features 
a rigid passenger cell, special 
deformation zones and restraint systems. 
Designer belt buckles at the 
front and rear support buckling up, because the lights of 
the belt buckle pulsate at that 
time. The car also gets an 
acoustic vehicle alert system 
where a special sound acts as 
a warning for pedestrians.
Charging
The car comes with a 22-kW 
standard wall box AC charger while supporting a 
maximum DC charging power of 
200 kW. Mercedes-Benz 
India says it will set up the 
largest ‘Ultra-fast charging 
network’, covering 80% of 
the country by end of 2022. 
This network will be exclusive to brands’ 
customers, with free and round the 
clock charging services being offered, for the first year.

Over the years, advertisements 
have crept into the YouTube experience as a way to 
support creators financially and maintain the 
platform.
However, it appears like YouTube is now going above 
and beyond with its advertising, playing 
up to 10 non-skippable adverts in 
a row. YouTube has given a statement 
in this regard informing that this 
experiment with advertisements 
has now “concluded”.
 On YouTube, commercial 
breaks generally show before the 
start of a video as well as throughout 
it if the creator permits it. 
These breaks can typically last 
a few seconds or a few minutes, 
but longer adverts typically offer 
the option to skip that ad after a 
certain amount of time.
Some YouTube users have 
noticed that, over the past few 
months, the number and length 
of adverts on the site have 
significantly increased, especially 
for unskippable formats. 
Some Twitter users recently
took to Twitter to mention, or 
rather claim that the application 
showed them breaks with as 
many as 10 ads in a row that can’t 
be skipped.
9to5 Google further reports 
that these longer breaks seem to 
be happening more frequently 
lately, though not with all films 
or with all viewers. 
Users with about five ads every 
break are more common than users 
with ten ads per break.
9to5 Google spoke to the Youtube 
spokesperson who revealed 
that the expanded number of 
ads was a part of a “small experiment” 
that has since “concluded.” 
He said, “At YouTube, we’re focused 
on helping brands connect 
with audiences around the world, 
and we’re always testing new 
supporting creators
ways to surface ads that enhance 
the viewer experience. 
We ran a small experiment 
globally that served multiple 
ads in an ad pod when viewers 
watched longer videos on connected TVs. 
The goal is to build a better experience for viewers by reducing 
ad breaks. We have concluded 
this small experiment.

As the fervour of 
dressing up for a 
festive occasion 
catches every woman’s imagination and metro denizens 
get inundated with party invitations, dressing up with 
a conscious and sustainable 
collection catches steam. 
Royal and palace ateliers are 
riding this wave. along with 
conscientious denizens who 
are looking keenly towards 
the world of the future and 
creating voices for local 
hand-made brands that are 
fair commerce at their core. 
This Diwali, the overdressed, glitzy glam look 
has been carefully replaced 
with artisanal, hand-made, 
hand-tucked and hand-embellished ensembles. Block 
printing tops this list. The 
free-flowing forms of the 
kaftan, the aabha kurtas, 
and the anarkalis worn with 
the chauda pyjamas take up 
every fashion diva’s mind 
space. At the royal ateliers, two 
brands ace this look. Rani 
Jaykirti Singh Baria’s studio tops this genre. Her 
block prints spell a cerebral 
beauty that few can match. 
Her blocks are a piece of art, 
what with the designs getting carved on teak wood 
using special equipment. 
For all the different hues we 
see in her designs, different 
blocks are used. The outline 
of the lead block is called the 
"rekh". The block that fills 
the foreground is known as 
"datta". For the background 
or blotches, we use a block 
called "gadh". When some 
thing is created with such 
elaborate effort, the results 
can be nothing but exquisite. 
The blocks made in her 
studio in Jaipur are more intricate 
and have more depth. 
The result is clearer printing 
and cleaner surfaces. What 
makes her prints even more 
intricate and endearing 
are the number of air passages, or "pavansar,"the 
blocks have. These holes 
drilled through the 
blocks ensure the circulation of air. 
While using the blocks, the holes 
prevent the fabric from 
lifting when the block 
is raised. Simple tech- 
niques lead to stunning 
ensembles created 
The Linen Zari Zameen 
Saree by Yumi.
painstakingly. 
Meanwhile, in Delhi, a new 
brand, Yumi, is slowly making inroads into this world of 
commitment. Moved by the 
plight of the Indian artisanal 
community and committed to a sustainable way of 
life, two design professionals, Natasha Chaudhri and 
Shilpa Gupta, launched 
Yumi. A fashion label that 
represents a unique curation of design-led, conscious 
women's wear that is hand 
block printed and woven by 
female artisans. Yumi also 
works with village artisans 
and women weavers to create special textiles and saris 
that are hand spun, hand 
woven, and dyed in natural 
dyes.
Inspired by the Japanese 
word "Yumi," which means 
"abundant beauty," the label attempts to take fashion 
seekers back to their roots. 
Inviting fashion seekers who 
are as committed to helping 
the planet heal, Yumi is uncompromisingly chic and 
high on its design and style 
quotient. Following a design-led, fair 
commerce philosophy, Yumi celebrates the 
abundant artisanal beauty of 
Indian handicrafts. It’s a collaborative initiative 
with artisans to revive and sustain 
the creative and traditional 
handicraft knowledge system of India.
Natasha Chaudhri and 
Shilpa Gupta share "We 
are committed to working 
with the artisans through 
special design interventions 
using natural fibres like fine 
linen, khadi, organic cotton, 
cotton silk, and muslin. 
"We are seeking to create 
contemporary markets for 
the products as an initiative 
to sustain the art form as a 
mark of deep respect for the 
artisans pursuing the handcraft despite the 
innumerable challenges," adds Shilpa. 
Shilpa and Natasha have 
been design entrepreneurs 
and restaurateurs for over 
22 years and are now 
inspired to serve vulnerable 
communities with love. 
Besides their fair commerce label that works 
with artisans, they have 
also curated Yumi Farm 
and supported small 
women village farmers and entrepreneurs 
to create a bouquet of 
farm products to support them through 
the pandemic. As 
an ode to children in 
villages, Natasha & 
Shilpa work closely to 
bring equal and fair literacy 
to children. This year they 
worked to set up a mobile library for children in a village 
in Jammu.
Another favourite for me 
this year is Label Pratham, 
brought alive by two young 
craft protagonists who are 
reviving the splendid aura 
of Pichwai and Kalamkari. 
Popular as the Pichwai 
Couple, Shweta and Prashant 
Garg started designing outfits for 
each other festive fervour
in early 2004. Little did they 
know that they would take 
up design as their profession 
in the future. Coming 
from steel business families 
and with no formal training 
in fashion, ‘Label Pratham’ 
was born out of the couples’ 
inclination towards art and 
design intricacies in 2011. 
Label Pratham is not just 
a brand but a true labour of 
love where each creation is 
motivated by the designers’ 
commitment to keep alive 
the unadulterated exuber- 
ance of the textile traditions 
of India in its designing process.
And this commitment has 
now led to graceful amalgamations of Pichwai with 
other traditional artforms 
and crafts like Kalamkari, 
Ajrakh, Jamdani, Paithani, 
and Aari & Ahir embroideries to suffuse the life of an 
Indian diva with aesthetic 
fashion.
Last on my list but never 
the least is the new born 
label Tinka Tinka, born 
from the ever exuberant brilliance of fashion 
protagonist Ishita Sudha 
Yashvi, who has emerged 
as such an icon of all things 
hand-made, local and 
unique. Her brand personifies her world. So what 
are you waiting for? Go get 
dressed for Diwali and also 
save the world.

Tokyo Olympic Games 
bronze medallist Lovlina 
Borgohain’s lastminute entry into the 36th 
National Games will spice 
up competition in the boxing 
ring at the Mahatma Mandir 
here from Wednesday. 
Lovlina, who suffered a minor injury on her 
nose during the selection trials for the 
Asian Championships, had 
earlier indicated that she 
would not be able to compete 
in the Games. A poor outing 
at the World Championships 
earlier this year, followed by 
a pre-quarterfinal exit from 
the Birmingham Commonwealth Games, did not do 
justice to the lanky Assamese boxer’s potential. 
Thus, the National Games 
could provide the two-time 
World Championship 69kg 
bronze medallist a perfect 
platform to assess herself 
ahead of the continental 
meet, starting on October 
30 in Amman, Jordan.
first t20i
Boxing Federation of India 
Secretary-General Hemanta 
Kumar Kalita said the Federation had requested the 
organising committee to allow the change of entry. 
“Accordingly, the Assam 
Amateur Boxing Association requested for Lovlina 
to be restored in place of her 
replacement Bhagyabati 
Kachari,” he said. “We hope 
Lovlina makes full use of the 
opportunity and gets back 
to shape before the Asian 
Championships,” Kalita said.
Along with Lovlina (75kg), 
all eyes will be on 21-year-old Jaismine Lamboria from 
the boxing nursery of Bhiwani in Haryana. Jaismine 
recently created history 
by becoming the first-ever 
female boxer to join the Indian Army on Sports quota 
after her recent 60kg bronze 
medal in the Commonwealth 
Games. Jasmine is expected 
to face a stiff fight from Punjab’s Simranjit Kaur Baatth, 
the 2018 World Championship bronze medallist. 
Haryana’s former World 
Championships medallist 
Saweety Boora (75kg) and 
Poonam (57kg) and Assam 
pugilists Jamuna Boro (57kg) 
and ex-World Youth cham- 
pion Ankushita Boro (66kg) 
will also be among the leading women boxers expected 
to set the ring alight. Delhi’s 
Anjali Tushir and Lalita (Rajasthan) can use the platform 
to make waves.

Two major decisions became the subject of debate in 
the boxing event of the 36th 
National Games here. One is 
the headgear and the other 
one is on referee’s decision. 
In spite of getting the green 
signal from AIBA regarding 
headgear, it was made optional here.
Boxing’s international 
body AIBA has given green 
signal to the use of headgears due to increased 
number of head injuries in the 
recent past. Headgear was 
worn only in the first bout 
and it was not mandatory 
here. In the first bout of the 
day, Ankit of Haryana and 
Sai Kumar of SSCB wore 
headgear. In this way history 
was created because after 
Rio Olympics headgear has 
not been used in any of the 
men’s tournaments. Here after 
the first bout no one wore 
headgear in any of the next 
bouts. The decision which 
the organizers took became 
a subject of ridicule because 
the use of headgear was not 
mandatory here as directed 
by AIBA.
The second controversy 
was seen in the men’s flyweight category when 
referee took decision of RSC 
(Referee stop contest) in a 
bout between Ajay Pendor 
of Maharashtra and Javed of 
Uttar Pradesh, when Javed’s 
upper part of the eye started 
bleeding. 
The rule states that atleast 
four minutes should be spent 
on this issue. If the bleeding 
does not stop, the affected 
boxer may be taken out due 
to injury but in such cases 
the referee has no right to 
declare RSC.
It is a good sign that after 
weightlifting many prominent 
boxers are taking part 
in these games. Olympic 
medallist Lovlina Borgohain, World Championship 
medalists Simranjit Kaur, 
Jamuna Boro, Sweety Bura 
and former World Youth 
Champion Anushita Boro 
are also taking part. In the 
men’s category, Shiva Thapa, 
CWG medalist Hasamuddin, 
World Youth Champion Sachin Siwach, Asian 
Champion Sanjeet and 
Thailand Open Champions 
are the main attraction of 
this event. On the first day of 
this competition, Olympic 
medalist Lovlina won her 
bout against Nishi Bhardwaj 
of Bihar and big bout star 
Mohammad Hasamuddin 
defeated Satish from Uttar 
Pradesh convincingly.

A half-century from Aaron 
Finch and his 69-run partnership with 
wicketkeeper-batter Matthew Wade 
helped Australia clinch a 
thrilling three-wicket win 
over West Indies in the first 
T20I of two-match series in 
Carrara on Wednesday. 
Australia has taken a 1-0 
lead over WI in the two-match series. 
In the first innings, West Indies posted 
145/9 in 20 overs, with Kyle 
Mayers (39) top-scoring for 
his side. Pacer Josh Hazlewood (3/35) put brakes on 
scoring by the visitors and 
did not allow any big partnerships to prosper. 
Chasing 146, Australia kept losing 
wickets at regular intervals, 
but Finch (58) and Matthew 
Wade (39*) helped the hosts 
get across the line, winning 
by three wickets. Chasing 
146, WI pacers Sheldon 
Cotrell and Alzarri Joseph 
dismissed opener David 
Warner (14) and Mitchell 
Marsh (3), reducing Australia to 21/2. 
Finch and Green started to 
rebuild the innings after losing two important wickets. 
Joseph dislodged Cameron 
Green’s (14) leg stump, reducing Aussies to 56/3. 
West Indies continued to 
dominate Australian batters, sending back explosive 
batters Glenn Maxwell and 
Tim David for ducks. Australia was reduced to 58/5 in 
7.5 overs. Finch was joined 
by Wade. These two experienced batters 
kept the score-board ticking.

Ahead of his team’s first ODI 
against South Africa, Indian 
skipper Shikhar Dhawan said that the 
series is a nice exposure for 
everyone ahead of the 2023 50-over 
World Cup and it is important that 
he plays as many matches as possible 
ahead of the global cricketing 
event.
The first ODI of the three match 
series between India and South 
Africa will be held in Lucknow on 
Thursday. “This series is a good 
exposure ahead of the 2023 World 
Cup. Youngsters will get more 
exposure playing against a great 
team. There are benefits all around. 
It will increase their experience and 
confidence. They have been doing 
well. They will learn from their 
mistakes as they play more. It is 
important for me to play as much as 
possible ahead of the World Cup,” 
said Dhawan in a pre-match press 
conference.
Dhawan said that the whole 
team has practised well for the 
past two days and everyone is in 
a good groove and mindset. 
“This team is good. We have 
played with most of these boys in 
the West Indies and Zimbabwe. 
One or two new players have 
come into the team. There is a 
good tuning between everyone. 
There is great energy in new boys, 
they are confident,” he added. 
The left-hander lauded the T20I 
squad that won the series against 
South Africa by 2-1.
“I am sure that they will do well 
in T20 World Cup. The squad 
selected is the best BCCI could have 
chosen. My best wishes are with 
them,” he added.
On Team India’s recent death 
over bowling issues, Dhawan said 
that a lot of runs were scored by 
both the teams in the final two 
T20Is and conditions need to be 
kept in mind.
“It depends on the pitch, whether 
dew was there or not. It is difficult 
for bowlers when dew is there 
because the ball gets wet. In this 
weather, dew comes anyways. But 
one keeps learning. When we have 
meetings, we watch videos of the 
opponent, plan and discuss before 
the match,” he added.
Dhawan said that he tries to give 
a nice environment to the 
youngsters so that they can be 
themselves and communicate better 
with support staff and others. 
“I try to keep the atmosphere 
happy and relaxed as it helps 
performance. I share my experiences 
with them as to what to do 
in a certain situation. I learn a lot 
from them too. It is always give 
and take,” he added.
The veteran left-hander said that 
he feels blessed to have had such a 
great career and enjoys sharing his 
knowledge with the youngsters. 
“New responsibilities create new 
energy in me, I am able to see my 
potential and explore myself. I am 
enjoying my journey,” he added.

India played their last T20I 
match before the ICC T20 
World Cup in Australia. India’s 
captain Rohit Sharma is 
leaving no stone unturned to 
win the showpiece event and 
also realizes that the absence
of pacer Jasprit Bumrah is a 
big blow to the team.
“Lot of the guys haven’t 
been to Australia, which is 
why we wanted to go early. 
Play on some bouncy pitches in Perth and see what 
we can do there. Out of the 
15, only 7-8 have been there 
before, so wanted to make 
an effort to go there early. 
We’ve organised a couple 
of practice games. Bumrah 
is a big miss, but there are 
a few guys in the reckoning. 
We’ll make the call once we 
reach Australia,” said skipper Rohit Sharma in the 
post-match presentation 
ceremony. The Indian bowlers conceded over 200 runs 
in both the second and third 
T20I against South Africa 
raising concerns over India’s 
bowling.
“As a team, we said it at the 
beginning no matter what 
happens about the result, 
there’s always room for 
improvement. Even if we do 
well in all three departments, 
want to keep getting better.
Areas of concerns, we have 
to look at our bowling, what 
more options we can find in 
the powerplay, middle and 
death,” said Rohit Sharma. 
The Rohit Sharma-led India 
registered consecutive 
bilateral series wins beating 
both Australia and South 
Africa 2-1.
“We were playing two 
quality sides, have to go 
back and see what better we 
can do. It will be challenging 
and we need to find answers, 
still working towards that. 
Guys need lot more clarity 
in terms of what they want 
to achieve and it’s my job to 
make sure it happens. We 
want to continue to keep doing that,” said Rohit Sharma.

The Indian women’s table 
tennis team lost against Chinese Taipei 3-0 
on Wednesday in Chengdu, China, and 
was eliminated from the 
International Table Tennis 
Federation (ITTF) World 
Team Championships Finals 
2022 in the round of 16. 
Manika Batra, rated first in 
India, was defeated by Chen 
Szu-Yu, ranked 22nd in the 
world, 3-0 (11-7, 11-9, 11-3) in 
the opening match. Then, 
Cheng I-Cheng defeated 
national champion and gold 
medalist Sreeja Akula 3-1 (8- 
11, 11-5, 6-11, 9-11).
Diya Chitale, a teen, gave 
Liu Hsing-Yin a tough time 
in the third match, losing 3-2 
(6-11, 11-9, 11-9, 8-11, 7-11) 
despite her best efforts.
The Indian women’s table 
tennis had qualified for the 
knockouts after finishing 
second behind Germany in 
Group 5.
Singapore will now play 
Chinese Taipei in the quarterfinals.
The men’s team, meanwhile, face top seeds China 
in the round of 16 on Thursday after they 
escaped elimination from the ITTF World 
Championships Finals by 
the skin of their teeth after
losing against France but 
still entering the main draw 
courtesy of Hong Kong and 
their world rankings today. 
Earlier as a change of 
strategy, India opened with 
Manav Thakkar against 
Alexis Lebrun, ranked No. 
30 in the world, and the 0-3 
(6-11, 8-11, 8-11) loss straightaway pushed them on the 
back foot. G. Sathiyan, 
ranked No. 37, took on brother 
Felix Lebrun in the second 
tie. But the 86th- ranked 
Frenchman punched way 
above his weight to pummel 
the Indian in straight games
to win 11-4, 11-2, 11-6 and put 
his side 2-0 up.
Harmeet failed to with- 
stand the pressure despite 
putting up a fight, but Jules 
Rolland (141), ranked a few 
places below the Indian 
(124), won 11-13, 13-11, 7-11, 
11-8, 11-7 in the gripping third 
rubber to give France the 
top-of-the-table position in 
their group, despite a three way tie.
With three teams France, 
Germany and India finish- 
ing on the same points (7) 
with three wins and one loss 
each, France pitchforked itself to the top position on a 
head-to-head win over India. 
However, India’s 0-3 loss 
enabled Germany, who beat 
France 3-1 yesterday, to take 
the second spot in the group. 
Yet, a question mark was 
hanging before the Indians 
as their entry into the main 
draw depended on two 
teams as only two higher-ranked teams that finished 
third in their groups could 
have filled the two vacant 
slots in the top 16-team 
knockout. No. 12 Hong 
Kong sealed the second slot 
in Group 3 despite their 2-3 
loss to Romania.
The clincher for India was 
Hong Kong occupying second place in the group. 
In another three-way tie, Romania 
got elbowed to the third spot, 
and their world ranking was 
four slots below India’s! The 
last of the 16 team positions 
went to No. 8 England when 
they beat Australia 3-0 in 
their only win in Group 5. 
Though the Indian men 
have captured their knockout place, they will have to 
accept the unkindest cut in 
the main draw, despite toppling Germany, the No. 2 
team in the world, in their 
group matches. At the No. 2 
slot, they will face top-seed 
China first up in the prequarterfinals.

India U-17 National Women’s 
team head coach Thomas 
Dennerby on Wednesday 
announced 21 players squad 
for the FIFA U-17 World Cup 
2022 scheduled to begin next 
week.
India have been drawn into 
Group A alongside USA, 
Morocco and Brazil. They 
will face the USA on October 11, followed by Morocco 
and Brazil on October 14 
and October 17, respectively, 
at the Kalinga Stadium in 
Bhubaneswar. The other 
two venues for the FIFA 
U-17 Women’s World Cup 
India 2022 are Goa and Navi 
Mumbai. “It’s a new situation 
for everyone. India have never played in the World Cup 
before. This is a different ball 
game altogether. It’s a unique 
chance to show everyone 
that we have prepared well 
and will not allow anyone to 
run over us. Everyone wants 
to play the World Cup, but I 
can only select the best 21 in 
the squad,” Coach Dennerby 
said.
“When you are on the field, 
everything is held back be- 
hind and you just have to 
focus on the game. That’s 
what the girls need to do. We 
are not going into the tournament as the favourites. I 
believe the pressure then is 
on the opponents,” said the 
India coach said.
India squad for FIFA U-17 
Women’s World Cup 2022: 
Monalisha Devi Moirangth- 
em, Melody Chanu Keisham, 
Anjali Munda, Astam Oraon, Kajal, Naketa, Purnima

Despite the T20I series defeat against India, South 
Africa skipper Temba Bavuma said that the win in the 
third and final T20I against the hosts will boost their 
confidence. Rilee Rossouw’s unbeaten ton and Dwaine 
Pretorius’ three-wicket haul helped South Africa 
register a 49-run win over India here at the Holkar Stadium 
in Indore. India, however, went on to win the 
three-match T20I series 2-1. “A win like this is always good 
for confidence. We struggled with the bat in the first 
game, and our bowling wasn’t the best in the last game, 
but we were clinical today. A lot to take from this game. 
We didn’t turn up with the bat in the first game. In the 
second game, we couldn’t execute our plans. We were 
a lot clear in the field today, it was a lot more clinical 
performance today,” said Temba Bavuma in a post-match presentation.
The win not only gives the Proteas momentum 
heading into the upcoming ODI series but also instils some 
confidence ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 
Australia. “We need the points to qualify for the World 
Cup (next year). Some new guys will be coming in (for 
the ODI series) with some fresh energy. Every game 
from now on is important for us,” added the South 
Africa skipper.
Talking about the match, Rossouw’s ton and Quinton 
de Kock (68 off 43) fired South Africa to 227 in the third 
and final T20I.
India’s chase was off to a poor start after the hosts 
lost their skipper Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer in 
the first two overs. On a high-scoring pitch, no massive 
total was safe but India kept losing wickets at regular 
intervals to end at 178 all out in 18.2 overs. 
“It’s something that every cricketer goes through, 
lucky for me, tonight was my night. We had a discussion 
out there, and he (de Kock) said you be the guy 
scoring. They are a world-class side. I am glad that I 
could contribute to the winning side tonight,” said 
Rilee Rossouw said in a post-match presentation.
