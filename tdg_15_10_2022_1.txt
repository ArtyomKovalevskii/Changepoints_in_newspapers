
district court in 
Varanasi on Friday 
rejected the Hindu 
worshippers’ plea seeking ‘scientific investigation’ 
of ‘Shivling’ claimed to be 
found on the Gyanvapi complex.
If carbon dating and 
ground penetrating radar is 
permitted and if any damage 
is caused to the ‘Shivling’, 
then it would be in violation 
of the Supreme Court order 
to protect it and it might also 
hurt the religious sentiments 
of the general public,” the 
court said 
The Varanasi court fur- 
ther added, “It would not be 
proper to order the survey of 
Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and by giving such 
order the age, nature, and 
structure of the said Shivling 
is known, even this does not 
imply the possibility of a just 
solution”.  
Carbon dating is a scientific 
process that ascertains the 
age of an archaeological object or archaeological finds. 
Speaking to The Daily 
Guardian petitioner’s Advocate Vishnu Jain said, “Court 
has rejected our demand of 
seeking carbon dating. We 
will move to Supreme Court 
against this order, and challenge it there. I 
cannot announce the date as of now, 
but we’ll soon challenge this 
order in apex court,” 
The Hindu side had 
claimed that a ‘Shivling’ was 
found in the premises near 
the ‘wazukhana’ during the 
videography survey of the 
mosque premises, which 
was ordered by the court. 
However, the Muslim side 
said that the structure found 
was a ‘fountain’. The Hindu 
side had then submitted an 
application on September 22 
that sought a carbon dating 
of the object they claimed to 
be ‘Shivling’.
Earlier on 29 September, 
the Hindu side demanded a 
scientific investigation of the 
‘Shivling’ by the Archaeological 
Survey of India (ASI) 
and the carbon dating of ‘Argha’ and the area around it. 
The court had reserved 
the order in the Gyanvapi 
Mosque-Shringar Gauri case 
after hearing both sides’ arguments. 
Akhlaq Ahmed, representing the Muslim side had said 
that the plea by the Hindu 
side is not maintainable as it 
is against the order of the Supreme Court that stated pro- 
tecting the structure (which 
the Muslim side claims to be 
a fountain and the Hindu 
side claims to be a Shivling). 
“We responded to the application on carbon dating. 
Stone does not have the capacity to absorb carbon. The 
Supreme Court in its May 17 
order, according to which, 
the object that was found by 
the commission, had to be 
protected. The order of the 
SC will prevail, so the object 
cannot be opened. According 
to the Hindu side, the pro- 
cess will be scientific, even if 
it is so, there will be tampering with the object. Chemi- 
cals will be used for the test. 
We will take action based on 
the order by the court on October 14,” Ahmed said.

Punjab Chief Minister 
Bhagwant Mann on Friday met with his Haryana 
counterpart Manohar Lal
Khattar to discuss the Sutlej 
Yamuna Link (SYL) canal 
issue. However, the meeting remained inconclusive.  
Punjab bluntly refused to 
give water to Haryana saying 
that the state does not have
water to share. 
CM Mann said that the 
Chief Minister of Haryana 
spoke about the reconstruction of the canal which was 
closed on the issue of water
but when Punjab does not have 
enough water then the 
question of building the 
canal does not arise.  
After the meeting, Manohar Lal 
Khattar said, “The construction 
of SYL issue is a matter of our life 
and death.” 
Earlier also, a meeting was held 
with former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh and 
Union Minister Gajendra Shekhawat. There was no consensus 
in the meeting with Punjab then. 
The Supreme Court has asked 
for the construction of SYL, but 
Punjab has not agreed with the
proposal.
The Haryana CM said that the 
state government will inform 
Union Minister Gajendra Shekhawat about the meeting. 
Arguing his case, Punjab CM 
Mann said that the state is getting 
only 27 percent of its water from 
rivers and streams, and 73 percent of water is being supplied 
from land. So the question of giving water does not arise. Mann 
added, “Haryana is our younger 
brother, to solve the problem we 
will walk together to approach 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
and ask him to supply water from 
Ganga or Yamuna.” 
Mann also said that when Haryana was formed in 1966, Yamuna 
went to Haryana. “If we do not get 
any share from Yamuna, then why 
should we give water from Sutlejeas?” 
He said that when the dam overflows during the rainy season, 
states such as Haryana and Rajasthan advocate for not releasing 
water. But when we need water for 
Punjab’s crucial need, they ask for 
it. “Such a double standards cannot work”, Mann said. 
The Supreme Court had on 
September 6 directed the Union 
Jal Shakti Ministry to convene a 
meeting between the governments 
of Punjab and Haryana to resolve 
the canal dispute. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, Abhay 
S Oka and Vikram Nath, while 
hearing the SYL Canal issue between Haryana and Punjab asked 
the central government to hold a 
meeting between both the States 
and granted four months to file a 
report on the meeting. 
The apex court is scheduled to 
hear the matter on 19 January 2023. 
During its September 6 hearing, 
the bench observed that natural 
resources have to be shared, particularly in view of the security 
scenario in Punjab. 
“Water is a natural resource and 
living beings must learn to share 
it, whether it is individual or state. 
The matter cannot be looked at 
from the point of view of only 
one city or state. It’s the natural 
wealth to be shared and how it is 
to be shared is a mechanism to be 
worked out,” Justice Kaul said. 
Attorney General for India K.K. 
Venugopal appearing for the Ministry, said that the Centre is trying 
to bring together the states of Punjab and Haryana. 
Venugopal further said that 
Punjab is not cooperating in the 
matter. “The Centre had written 
a letter to the new Chief Minister 
of Punjab in April but there was 
deliver justice.” 
Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha staged massive

Diplomats see Lekhi’s blatant and fiery attack on Pakistan over terrorism 
as part of India’s larger strategy to send 
out a message to the global community 
ahead of the upcoming FATF session 
where Islamabad will seek its removal 
from the grey list. Significantly, Lekhi 
also called on Islamabad to immediately 
end cross-border terrorism. Sources 
said that India has intensified its efforts 
to draw attention of the FATF and other 
countries to Pakistan’s continuous backing 
to the terror activities against India 
from across the border. “Why should 
FATF not take this fact into account 
also?” asks a diplomat. That Pakistan’s 
intelligence agency ISI provides assistance 
to the terror groups is no secret, 
sources said. Recently, India has shared 
evidence with the US, the UK and other 
key nations that establish Pakistan’s 
army links with the terrorists who 
were either eliminated or caught alive 
in Jammu and Kashmir, sources added. 
“New Delhi wants all these inputs to be 
taken into account by the FATF. These 
facts expose Pakistan’s false claims”,

“To the festive month of October, we 
are going to add the festival of democracy,” Chief Election Commissioner 
Rajiv Kumar told reporters while announcing the election schedule. 
Himachal Pradesh voted to elect its 
legislative assembly on 9 November 
2017. In the 68-member Himachal 
Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 
defeated the Congress Party and won 
44 seats while Congress secured only 
21 seats in 2017. 
At present, in Himachal Pradesh legislative assembly, the BJP has 45 MLAs, 
no response,” he said. 
To this, the bench directed all 
the parties to cooperate. “Either 
they sit and talk or the Court will 
order the execution of the decree. 
These issues should not be allowed 
to fester... It will allow forces that 
may not be amicable to the country 
to act and interfere,” observed the 
top court.
On 28 July 2020, the top court 
had asked the Chief Ministers of 
both states to make an attempt to 
resolve the issue amicably. The 
Ministry had earlier held several 
meetings which were attended by 
Chief Secretaries of the two states 
but remained in conclusive.

India on Friday stressed 
on the need of overall 
protection of children by 
safeguarding them with 
conducive legislation and 
eco-system. Taking the lead 
at the 145th Asssembly of the 
Inter-Parliamentary Union 
(IPU), Indian parliamentar- 
ian Kartikeya Sharma said it 
is crucial to focus on vulner- 
able children. 
On day 4 of the session, he 
was participating a workshop on the Rights of the 
Child on the theme ‘Child friendly Parliaments: The 
case for stronger parliamentary action in support of
child rights’. 
Kartikeya Sharma said, 
“Children constitute principle assets of any country. 
Children’s development is 
very important for the overall development of society, 
and the best way to develop 
national human resources 
is to take care of children 
under the age of 18 as it constitutes 30 per cent of India’s 
population. They represent 
not at India’s future, but are 
integral to securing India’s 
present. The Constitution 
of India obliges the government to make necessary 
provisions to advance rights and 
wellbeing of children.” 
“Moreover the recognition
of the need for promoting 
greater child responsiveness in India’s policies is also reflected in our 
National Policy for Children (2013), 
the National Plan of Action for Children (2016) 
and New Education Policy (2020),” he added. 
Talking about protection of children, he stated that, 
“It is crucial for us to focus on vulnerable 
children such as street children orphans, 
child labor, migrant children, etc. in our policy 
and financial statements while reviewing our 
child development schemes the catastrophic 
impact of Covid-19 has further increased the 
risks and vulnerabilities of children and therefore, 
corresponding welfare measures would 
be crucial along with adequate allocation and 
increase in the expenditure on children.”

The Bharatiya Janata Party 
on Thursday intensified its 
attack on Aam Aadmi Party 
and its Gujarat president 
Gopal Italia for remarks on 
Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi and his mother. 
BJP made a frontal attack 
with protests in Delhi and 
also launching firebrand 
Union Minister Smriti Irani. 
Lashing out at Delhi Chief 
Minister Kejriwal, Irani 
said that the CM was falling 
to new lows.  
“With blessings of Arvind 
Kejriwal, AAP leadership in 
Gujarat maliciously attacked 
flood posts (baadh chowki) 
are established. We are not 
running any Zomato service, the government is not 
running Zomato,” the DM 
said, addressing the flood-affected people in 
Ambedkar Nagar and asking them 
to collect relief materials. 
The Mumbai Police on 
Friday made seat belts mandatory for motor vehicle drivers and 
commuters from 1 November. 
The Press Note from the Joint

(amendment), act, 2019, under 
149 (b) (1) whoever drives a 
motor vehicle without a seat 
belt and carries passengers 
not wearing seat belts shall be 
punishable”. as per the press 
note, a time period till November 
1, has been given to install a seat 
belt facility for all commuters.
Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi’s 100-year-old mother. 
That Kejriwal could fall to 
new lows is not surprising 
Her only crime is she gave 
birth to Narendra Modi. Your 
leaders and workers seek to 
punish and abuse her,” Irani 
told reporters here. 
Earlier, in a Twitter post, 
Irani said, “Arvind Kejriwal, 
gutter mouth Gopal Italia 
now abuses Hira Ba with 
your blessings. I prefer no 
outrage, I do not want to 
show how indignant Guja- 
ratis are but know this you

anger over the indecency of 
his workers and did not stop 
them from doing so. On the 
contrary, he is promoting Gopal Italia on social media”, he 
charged.
Italia was detained by the 
Delhi Police after he was 
summoned by the National 
Commission of Women 
(NCW) on Thursday. The
NCW chief summoned Italia

With Pakistan set to submit 
its response to the Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF) 
over the grey list at the upcoming meet from 18-21 
October in Paris, India has 
urged the money laundering 
and terror financing watch- 
dog “not to trust Islamabad’s 
claim that it has complied 
with all the conditions”
New Delhi has reached out 
to the FATF through diplomatic channels ahead of the 
body’s meeting next week to 
thwart Pakistan’s attempt to 
get off the ‘grey list’, sources 
told The Daily Guardian. “Pakistan is learnt to 
have prepared its response 
for the FATF, claiming that 
it has complied with almost all the 
conditions, including the prevention of 
money laundering and terror financing,” 
diplomatic sources said, adding, “India 
wants the watchdog to be cautious while 
dealing with Pakistan’s case during the 
session.” “Pakistan must not be taken 
out of the grey list, given its inability to 
rein in terror outfits and to stop fund- 
ing to them,” Indian diplomats told the 
FATF, according to sources.
Sources said that Pakistan’s Minister 
of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani 
Khar will leave for Paris on October 
16 to attend the FATF meeting during 
which discussions will be held to take 
Pakistan off the grey list of the forum. 
Pakistan’s interior ministry is learnt 
to have prepared “a detailed response” 
to be submitted by Khar to the FATF. 
Sources told TDG that Pakistan’s claims 
on tackling terrorism and funding of 
terror organisation are hollow and have 
no substance at all. “The terror funding 
watchdog must not trust the claims 
protect vulnerable ballistic missiles from 
without cross checking them with the 
evidence its team collected during recent 
visit to Pakistan. Also, evidence 
provided by India will help the forum to 
cross check the claims,” sources added. 
“Pakistan’s backing to terror outfits and 
camps, its involvement in infiltration 
and arms supply to them is something 
that all the members of FATF are aware 
of. Moreover, substantial evidence is 
also lying with them that establishes 
all the findings,” sources said. India has 
now proved on many occasions that 
terror camps still exist in Pakistan and the 
global community must not turn a blind 
eye to the same.  
Addressing the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building 
Measures (CICA) Summit in Astana 
recently, Minister of State for External 
Affairs Meenakshi Lekhi unequivocally 
called Pakistan as the global epicentre of 
terrorism. “Pakistan is the global epicentre of terrorism and continues to be the 
source of terrorist activities, including 
in India. Pakistan continues to make 
no investment in human development 
but provides their resources for creating 
and sustaining infrastructure of terrorism,” Lekhi said.
Diplomats see Lekhi’s blatant and fiery attack on Pakistan over terrorism 
as part of India’s larger strategy to send 
out a message to the global community 
ahead of the upcoming FATF session

At a time when Uttar 
Pradesh is reeling under 
a flood situation, a video 
of the District Magistrate 
(DM) of Ambedkar Nagar 
went viral, where the official is heard saying that the 
government is not running 
“Zomato” to provide door-to-door service or 
relief materials to people in the flood-hit 
areas.
“...If you need, you will be 
provided with chlorine tablets, and a doctor will come 
to see you when one falls 
sick, this is the reason why
flood posts (baadh chowki) 
are established. We are not 
running any Zomato service, the government is not 
running Zomato,” the DM 
said, addressing the flood-affected people in 
Ambedkar Nagar and asking them 
to collect relief materials. 
This came at a time when 
the flood water started entering 
the houses of the locals here. 
Addressing the people here, he 
asked them to fix their time so that the food 
could be prepared accordingly.
“Firstly, you all prepare a time for feast at 
the flood post, then as many people would 
be present in the morning, the food for the 
same number of people can be prepared in 
the evening.” he said. 
Nearly a month ago, Uttar Pradesh Chief 
Minister Yogi Adityanath on 18 September 
directed the administration to be on alert, 
following the increase in the water level of 
the Kuano River at Chandradeep Ghat. 
In a high-level meeting chaired by Yogi 
Adityanath earlier this week, instructions 
were issued to expedite the relief and 
rehabilitation work in all the districts affected by 
heavy rains. CM Yogi also ordered to keep 
the District Control Room functional 24x7 
under the leadership of Joint Magistrate level 
officers.
Yogi instructed the officials of Gonda, Basti, 
Ambedkar Nagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur, 
Azamgarh, Deoria, Mau, Ballia, and 
Ayodhya to be on alert in view of the possible 
threat of floods.
“Due to excessive rains in the last few days,

has been reported in many districts. The 
State Government is committed to making 
necessary arrangements for the safety and

“Immediate help should be provided to

areas. There should be no delay in the

adequate arrangements for lighting etc. in

The Centre on Friday told 
the Supreme Court that the 
methodology of the electoral 
bond scheme is a “completely 
transparent” mode of political 
funding and it is impossible 
to get black money or unaccounted money.
Solicitor General Tushar 
Mehta defended the electoral 
bonds scheme before a bench 
of Justices BR Gavai and 
BV Nagarathna. Before the 
bench, Justices BR Gavai and 
BV Nagarathna. The Solicitor 
General said, “The methodology of donation is 
so transparent, it is impossible to get black 
money... It is most transparent 
and to say it strikes at democracy is wrong.” The top court 
was hearing a batch of pleas 
challenging the provisions of 
the Finance Act 2017 which 
paved the way for anonymous 
electoral bonds.
During the hearing, advocate Prashant Bhushan, 
appearing for petitioners, 
argued that the case involves 
issues that strike at the roots 
of democracy.
Bhushan further pointed 
out that the Finance Bill of 
2017, which paved the way 
for the introduction of the 
electoral bond scheme, was 
passed as a money bill even 
though it wasn’t.
Senior advocate Kapil 
Sibal, appearing for one of the 
petitioners, said that this is a 
matter that should be heard 
by a larger bench.
Attorney General R Venkataramani stated that there 
is no pressing urgency and 
requested that the case be 
listed in January 2023 by the 
court.
However, Bhushan and 
Sibal pointed out that there 
are elections coming up in 
Gujarat, which would be announced today. They objected 
to the AG’s suggestion of a 
hearing in January, saying 
that would mean more sales 
of bonds. The apex court then 
listed the case for hearing on 
December 6.
The various petitions filed 
were filed in the apex court 
challenging the provisions of 
the Finance Act 2017 which 
paved the way for anonymous electoral bonds.
The Association for Democratic Reforms, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) 
and others had approached 
the apex court in 2017 to 
challenge the scheme as an 
“obscure funding system 
which is unchecked by any 
authority”.
An electoral bond is an 
instrument in the nature of 
a promissory note or bearer 
bond which can be purchased by any individual, 
company, firm or association of persons, provided 
the person or body is a citizen of India or incorporated 
or established in India. The 
bonds are issued specifically 
for the purpose of contributing funds to political parties.
The electoral bond 
scheme was notified by the 
central government on January 2, 2018.

The Centre has upgraded 
the security of Assam Chief 
Minister Himanta Biswa 
Sarma from the ‘Z’ category 
cover in the North-Eastern 
region to the ‘Z+’ category 
on an India basis, sources 
said.
The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which is 
currently providing Sarma 
with ‘Z’ category security, will now facilitate him 
with ‘Z+’ category security. 
Sources said that the move 
comes after the security arrangement for Sarma was 
reviewed in the Ministry 
of Home Affairs (MHA) in 
consultation with the Central Security Agency and it 
has been decided to upgrade 
his present ‘Z’ category 
CRPF security cover in the 
North-Eastern region to 
‘Z+’ category CRPF security 
cover on an all India basis.
The MHA has requested 
the CRPF to provide ‘Z+’ 
category security cover to 
Sarma on an all-India ba- 
sis, said the sources.
As per the ‘Z+’ category 
security protocol, over 50 
commandos would accompany the Assam CM 
whenever he travels any where within the country. 
Sarma was accorded a 
“Z” category security cover 
by the CRPF in 2017. Under 
earlier security arrangements, the ‘Z’ category of 
security was being provided to Sarma within the

families of the deceased and 
provide proper treatment to the injured.
Reviewing the impact on 
agricultural crops, the Chief

of opportunity and will be 
able to produce 25 per cent 
of its crude oil demand by 
2030.
At present, five million barrels of petroleum are being

2022, five months ahead of schedule.
“It is reducing 2.7 million 
tonnes of CO2 emissions, 
which is good for the environment. According to 
the International Energy 
Agency (IEA), India will 
contribute a quarter (25%) of 
the growth in global energy 
consumption over the next 
two decades. BP estimates 
that India’s energy demand 
will double, while natural 
gas demand is expected to 
grow five-fold by 2050,” said 
the Minister.
At the event, Petroleum 
Secretary Pankaj Jain said 
the geology experts should 
use this opportunity to enhance their contribution in 
the context of increasing demand and scarcity of energy 
sources.
Earlier, welcoming the dignitaries and participants, Rajesh

The Supreme Court on Friday 
said that there was no urgency 
to hear the matter against freebies promised by the political 
parties during election campaigns.
The petition seeking an urgent hearing of the plea was 
mentioned for urgent hearing before the Supreme Court 
today. At that, Advocate Ashwini Upadhyay mentioned 
the matter before a bench of 
Chief Justice UU Lalit and 
Justice Hemant Gupta, saying 
elections are to be announced 
in Gujarat and parties are 
making irresponsible prom- 
ises. CJI Lalit then said there 
was no urgent hearing and 
asked to send the files of the 
case to his chambers. 
Earlier, a bench headed by 
the then CJI NV Ramana had 
said that the issue of freebies 
promised by the political 
parties during election campaigns requires extensive 
debate, and referred the case to a 
three-judge bench.
The top court’s order came 
on a batch of pleas against 
freebies promised by politi- 
cal parties. The top court had 
asked the Centre the reason 
behind not calling for an 
all-party meeting to determine 
issues relating to the promise of 
freebies during election campaigns. It has also been said 
that it cannot prevent political 
parties from making promises 
during election campaigns, 
but the question is what constitutes the right promises and 
what is the right way of spending public money. 
Political parties such as 
the Aam Aadmi Party, the 
Congress, and the Dravida 
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) 
sought to intervene and oppose the plea.
AAP had filed an application stating that electoral 
promises such as free water, 
electricity, and free transport 
are not “freebies,” but that 
these schemes are absolutely 
essential in an unequal society. 
One of the pleas filed by 
Upadhyay sought direction 
to seize election symbols and 
deregister political parties that 
promised to distribute irrational freebies from public funds. 
The plea had claimed that 
political parties’ arbitrary 
promises or irrational freebies for wrongful gain and to 
lure voters in their favour is 
analogous to bribery and undue influence. It claimed that 
the promise or distribution of 
irrational freebies from public 
funds before elections could 
unduly influence the voters, 
shake the roots of a free and 
fair election, and disturb the 
level playing field, besides 
vitiating the purity of the election process.

The Saket District Court has 
dismissed a complaint seeking 
a direction to the Delhi Police 
to investigate against Delhi 
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Cabinet Minister Gopal 
Rai, MLA Prakash Jarwal and 
others in relation to the Delhi 
Assembly Elections 2020. 
The complainant had filed 
the complaint under Section 
156(3) of the Code of Criminal 
Procedure (CrPC) stating that 
MLA Prakash Jarwal was not 
eligible to contest the elections 
from Deoli (SC) Assembly 
Constituency-47, which was 
reserved for the Scheduled 
Caste Community. Arvind 
Kejriwal and Gopal Rai made 
him the candidate for the Assembly polls. The 
complainant, Dal Chand Kapil, stated 
that he is a member of the 
Scheduled Caste Community 
who had contested Legislative Assembly Elections from 
Deoli (SC) Assembly Constituency-47 in the years 2015 and 
2020. Prakash Jarwal also 
contested these elections from 
the Deoli (SC) Assembly constituency in 2015 and 2020. 
The complainant alleged 
that Prakash Jarwal was deliberately made a candidate 
from the Deoli (SC) Assembly 
constituency only to deprive 
any member of the Scheduled 
Caste Community of getting 
elected from the reserved constituency.
The Supreme Court on Friday 
dismissed the petition to disqualify Satyendar Jain, MLA 
and Minister in the state government, who has been in 
judicial custody in a money laundering case since May 30, and 
declared him as “a person of 
unsound mind” and disqualified him from the Assembly on 
this ground.
A bench of justices Sanjay 
Kishan Kaul and Abhay S. Oka 
dismissed the plea with cost. 
The court ordered that the fee 
be paid within four weeks to the 
Supreme Court Mediation and 
Conciliation Project Committee 
(MCPC).
The petitioner, Ashish Kumar 
Srivastava, has filed his petition 
through Advocate-on-Record 
Nirmal Kumar Ambastha and 
advocate Rudra Vikram Singh. 
The petitioner has challenged 
the Delhi High Court order dated August 16, 2022.
The petitioner submitted that 
the Delhi government is clearly 
violating the provisions of the 
Constitution of India under Article 191, which clearly states that 
a person shall be disqualified for 
being chosen as, and for being, 
a member of the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council of 
State if he is of unsound mind. 
The petitioner further submitted that one of the Cabinet 
Ministers in the Delhi Government, Satyendra Kumar Jain, 
also a member of the Legislative 
Assembly from Shakur Basti 
Assembly constituency since 
2015, declared that he had lost
his memory before the Officers 
of the Enforcement Directorate, and the same had also been 
informed to the Special Judge 
Rouse Avenue District Court, 
New Delhi by the Additional 
Solicitor General.
But unfortunately, he is still 
continuing the important Cabinet Minister portfolio in the 
Delhi government and is still 
enjoying the post of Member of 
the Legislative Assembly of the 
Delhi Assembly, the petitioner 
said. Hence, the petitioner submitted that the Court may 
declare Satyendra Jain a person 
with an unsound mind and 
subsequently disqualify him 
from being a Member of the 
Legislative Assembly or Cabinet Minister in the government 
of the NCT of Delhi.
Earlier, the Principal District 
and Sessions Judge Vinay Kumar Gupta on September 23 
agreed to transfer the Satyender 
Jain money laundering case to 
another judge and listed the 
matter afresh for hearing today 
itself.
According to the order, the 
case was transferred to Special 
Judge Vikas Dhull. Earlier, it was 
heard at length by Special Judge 
Geetanjali Goel.
The ED on June 6 claimed to 
have seized Rs 2.85 crore in cash 
and 133 gold coins weighing 1.80 
kg from Satyendra Jain’s aides 
during its day-long raid conducted at various places across Delhi 
and the National Capital Region 
(NCR). During these raids, the 
agency also seized various incriminating documents and 
digital records.

articipating in a 
workshop on the 
Rights of the Child 
on the theme “Child-friendly Parliaments: The case 
for stronger parliamentary 
action in support of child 
rights” at the 145th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamen- 
tary Union (IPU) here on 
Friday, Indian parliamentarian Kartikeya Sharma 
said that it is crucial to focus on vulnerable children. 
The young MP said, “Children constitute the 
principal asset of any country. 
Children’s development 
is very important for the 
overall development of society, and the best way to 
develop national human 
resources is to take care of 
children under the age of 18 
as they constitute 30 percent of India’s population. 
They represent not only India’s future but are integral 
to securing India’s present 
The Constitution of India 
obliges the government to 
make necessary provisions 
to advance the rights and 
wellbeing of children.” 
“Moreover the recognition of the need for promoting greater child respon- 
siveness in India’s policies 
is also reflected in our National Policy for Children 
(2013), the National Plan of 
Action for Children (2016) 
and the New Education 
Policy (2020),” he added. 
Talking about protection of children, he stated 
that, “It is crucial for us to 
focus on vulnerable children such as street 
children, orphans, child labor, 
migrant children, etc. in 
our policy and financial 
statements while reviewing our child development 
schemes. The catastrophic 
impact of COVID-19 has 
further increased the risks 
and vulnerabilities of children and, therefore, cor- 
responding welfare measures would be crucial 
along with adequate allocation and increase in the 
expenditure on children.” 
He stated that India upholds a large range of 
international instruments 
and decisions pertaining 
to the rights of all children 
to protection, security, 
and dignity. “We are party 
to the UN Convention on 
the Rights of the Child 
(UNCRC) and the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
(CEDAW). We even ratified the International Labour Organization (LO) 
Convention No. 182 on 
the Worst Forms of Child 
Labour, 1999, and are taking effective measures to 
secure the prohibition and 
elimination of the worst 
forms of child labour in the 
country,” he further added. 
It is widely acknowledged 
that investing in children 
contributes significantly 
towards inclusive and sustainable human development. Hence, our progress 
in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) requires a high 
degree of child involvement in our policies and 
programmes.
“The Indian Parliament 
has played a vital role in 
enacting several laws for 
the welfare and the fuller 
development of children. 
Child Labour (Prohibition 
and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, 
the Juvenile Justice (Care and 
Protection of Children) 
Act 2015, the Protection 
of Children from Sexual 
Offences Act 2012, the 
Right of Children to Free 
and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, the 
Prohibition of Child Marriage 
Act 2006 the Commission 
for Protection of Child 
Rights Act 2005, and PreConception and Pre-Natal 
Diagnostic Techniques 
(PCPNDT) Act 1994 are 
some of the major initiatives of Parliament of India 
for protecting children’s 
interests and benefits,” he 
said while talking about 
laws for protection of children in India.
“Further our parliamentarians have been taking 
up problems confronted by 
children, especially those 
relating to their health, 
education, nutrition, recreation, and protection from 
exploitation and abuse, 
through questions and 
other procedural devices 
for drawing the attention 
of the Government.” 
While talking about the 
importance of the importance of legislatures as 
advocates for children, he 
said, “Legislatures are one 
of the key political arenas 
where elected officials can 
effectively advocate for 
a greater, more efficient, 
and equitable allocation of 
resources to advance chil- 
dren’s rights. They play a 
crucial role in preparing a 
legal and fiscal framework 
focusing on the differential 
needs of children. Further 
deliberations in Parliament 
and various Parliamentary 
Committees help in incorporating children’s needs 
into government policies, 
programmes, intervention 
and as an important strategy for mainstreaming child 
welfare in the development 
process.”

Taruni Ganghi

Border Security Force (BSF) 
troops shot down a drone 
that entered India in Punjab’s 
Gurdaspur sector from the 
Pakistan side on the International Border in the early 
hours of Friday.
A senior BSF officer said 
that the drone was spotted 
at 4.35 am by BSF troops on 
patrolling duty. They immediately opened fire and it was 
shot down.
According to the BSF official, a massive search 
operation has been launched in the 
area to determine whether 
the drone has dropped any 
consignment in the area. 
A search operation is underway under the supervi- 
sion of BSF DIG. It is suspected that the drone was 
carrying a consignment from 
Pakistan.
“Brave jawans of BSF spotted a drone coming from 
Pakistan side. As soon as it 
entered India, jawans fired 
17 rounds of bullets at it. One 
of the blades of the drone was 
damaged. The entire area is 
being searched. The drone 
will be analysed,” said BSF 
DIG, Gurdaspur, Prabhakar 
Joshi.
Pertinent to mention, in the 
past nine months, security 
forces have observed the illegal entry of 191 drones into 
Indian territory from neighbouring Pakistan, raising 
major concerns in terms of 
internal security in the country. The central government 
recently shared the input 
from the security forces deployed at the India-Pakistan 
border to maintain such illegal attempts from the Pakistan side. Of the 191 drones 
observed, 171 entered into 
Indian territory through the 
India-Pakistan border along 
the Punjab sector while 20 
were seen in the Jammu sector, a document accessed by 
the ANI mentions.
As per the document, the 
“UAV (Unmanned Aerial 
Vehicle) observation in IndoPak border was seen in Pun- 
jab and Jammu frontier with 
effect from January 1, 2022, to 
September 30, 2022”.
The documents further 
reveal that most of these 
drones or UAVs managed to 
flee while a total of seven have 
been shot down by the Border 
Security Force (BSF) personnel, who are deployed along 
the India-Pakistan border 
to keep a tab on such illegal 
activities being orchestrated 
by Pakistan’s Inter-Services 
Intelligence.
Among seven drones shot 
down this year between January 1 to September 15 were 
observed in Punjab’s Amritsar, Ferozpur and Abohar 
regions. Officials in the BSF told 
ANI that drones are being 
used by Pakistan’s side to 
transport weapons, explosives and narcotics across 
the international border in 
Jammu and Punjab from 
Pakistan.
The increased drone activity across the border was 
brought to the notice of Home 
Minister Amit Shah in the 
security review meeting in 
Srinagar recently with top security and intelligence chiefs 
in attendance. While BSF, 
which mans the international 
border with Pakistan in the 
Jammu sector, believes that it 
has been able to repel drones 
carrying arms, ammunition 
and explosives from Pakistan, the state police and the 
intelligence agencies differ 
with this assessment.

The first meeting of the four-membered committee to 
examine the World Health Organisation’s report regarding 
Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd 
was held on Thursday. 
The committee comprises 
of technical experts Dr YK 
Gupta, Vice Chairperson 
of the Standing National 
Committee on Medicines 
(chair), Dr Pragya Yadav, 
Indian Council of Medical 
Research- National Institute 
of Virology (ICMR -NIV) in 
Pune, Dr Arti Bahl, Division 
of Epidemiology, National 
Centre for Disease Control 
(NCDC) in New Delhi, and 
AK Pradhan, JDC(I) in Central Drugs Standard Control 
Organisation (CDSCO). According to the sources from 
Union Health Ministry, the 
experts here discussed and 
intensified the investigation 
into the matter.
“The government is alerted 
and has formed a committee. 
Production of cough syrups 
by Maiden Pharmaceuticals 
Ltd has been suspended, 
and its lab report is awaited. 
A four-member expert committee has been formed to 
investigate the report sent 
by WHO,” sources said. 
According to the media reports , Atlanta-based 
Atlantic Pharmaceuticals Company Ltd which has permission 
to export medicines to West 
Africa’s Gambia had ordered 
combined cough syrup bottles that were purchased 
from Maiden Pharmaceuticals limited.
“From the preliminary 
inquiry of CDSCO, it has 
been revealed that Maiden 
Pharmaceuticals Ltd is a 
manufacturer licensed by 
the State Drug Controller 
for the product’s Promethazine Oral Solution BP, 
Kofexnalin Baby cough syrup, 
MaKoff Baby Cough Syrup 
and MaGrip n Cold Syrup 
under reference, and holds 
manufacturing permission 
for these products for export 
only,” the sources said. 
The company has manufactured and exported these 
products only to the Gambia. 
“It is a usual practice that 
the importing country tests 
such medicines on quality parameters, and 
satisfies itself with the product’s 
quality before the importing country decides to 
release them for usage in the 
country. In the present case, 
it is not yet clear whether 
these medicines were tested 
in the Gambia before release,” they added.

can accommodate 20,638 
prisoners and contrary to 
this, as on the first week of 
September month this year, 
there were 26,049 prisoners

Congress leader Priyanka 
Gandhi Vadra on Friday 
said that if the party is voted 
to power in the forthcoming 
Himachal Pradesh assembly elections, a decision will 
be taken on restoring the old 
pension scheme in the first 
meeting of the cabinet. 
Addressing ‘Parivartan 
Pratigya Rally’ here, the 
Congress leader said a decision will also be taken at 
the cabinet meeting to provide one lakh government 
jobs. She targeted the BJP 
government in the state and 
alleged that it has done nothing for youth, employees and 
women.
“You should think about 
your future. BJP doesn’t have 
money for pensions but they 
can waive off loans of their 
big businessmen. They have 
nothing for youth, employees and women. 
Government posts are lying vacant 
for the last five years,” Priyanka Gandhi said.
“I am giving you a guarantee today that after forming 
the government here, two 
major decisions will be taken 
in the first cabinet meeting. 
First is to give one lakh govPriyanka Gandhi Vadra
ernment jobs and the second 
is to implement old pension 
scheme (OPS),” she added. 
The Congress is in the process of deciding its 
candidates for the assembly polls. 
The party is without its tall 
leader Virbhadra Singh in 
this election. He passed away 
last year. Himachal has been 
witnessing a bipolar contest 
between Congress and the 
BJP but Aam Aadmi Party is 
also trying to make its presence felt.
EC announced the schedule for the assembly election 
in Himachal Pradesh on Friday. The state will go to the 
polls on November 12 and 
the counting of votes will be 
held on December 8.
In the previous election, 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday 
opposed the bail application 
filed by former Maharashtra 
Home Minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) 
leader Anil Deshmukh in 
connection with the Rs 100 
crore extortion matter. 
Deshmukh had filed a petition for bail in the CBI court, 
on which the CBI has filed 
its reply today, to which the 
lawyer of Anil Deshmukh 
will now argue on October 
18. The next hearing of the 
case will be on October 18. 
Meanwhile, the NCP leader 
was taken to Jaslok Hospital 
from Arthur Road Jail today. 
He was admitted to Jaslok 
Hospital today after the 
special PMLA court had allowed Anil Deshmukh to 
undergo angiography in a 
private hospital. 
Deshmukh had been ac- 
cused of asking policemen 
to collect Rs 100 crores illegally for him every month 
from bar owners in Mumbai. 
Earlier on October 11, the 
Supreme Court refused to 
cancel the bail granted to 
the former home minister in 
the money laundering case 
lodged against him by Enforcement Directorate (ED). 
A bench headed by Justice 
DY Chandrachud refused to 
interfere with the Bombay 
High Court order which 
granted bail to Deshmukh. 
Enforcement Directorate has approached the 
apex court challenging the 
Bombay High Court’s order 
granting bail to Deshmukh, 
who was arrested in connection with a money laundering case. 
On October 4, the Bombay 
High Court had granted bail 
to Deshmukh in a money 
laundering case being investigated by the ED. 
Deshmukh continues to be 
in judicial custody in Arthur 
Road prison as he is also being investigated by the Cen- 
tral Bureau of Investigation 
(CBI) in a corruption case. 
Deshmukh was arrested 
by the ED in November 2021 
and is currently in judicial 
custody.
According to the ED, 
Deshmukh had misused his 
position as state home minister and collected Rs 4.70 
crore from various bars in 
Mumbai through some police of officers.

Hitting out at Chief Minister 
Mamata Banerjee’s led government over the Mominpur 
violence, Leader of the Opposition (LOP) in the West 
Bengal Assembly Suvendu 
Adhikari on Friday alleged 
that the ruling Trinamool 
Congress (TMC) wants to 
remove Hindus from certain 
areas in Kolkata.
“They (TMC) want to remove Hindus from Mominpur, Iqbalpur, and Khidirpur. This is Chief Minister 
Mamata Banerjee’s vote 
bank politics. Hindu vote 
is going towards the BJP 
and CM Banerjee is taking 
minority votes by threatening and doing communal 
campaigns,” Adhikari told 
the press. Earlier, Adhikari 
wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Governor 
La Ganesan demanding an 
urgent deployment of central 
forces in the region.
“The Hindu community 
has come under attack in 
Khidirpore Mominpur area 
of Kolkata on the eve of Lakshmi Puja,” Adhikari, also 
the leader of the opposition, 
said in the letter.
He said many shops and 
bikes belonging to Hindus 
were vandalised by hooligans and anti-social elements in the violence. “The 
onslaught has similarities 
to the Panchla violence, 
which happened in June in 
the Uluberia area of Howrah district. At that time, the 
violence spread across West 
Bengal, especially in Nadia 
and Murshidabad districts,” 
Adhikari wrote. Meanwhile, 
the Calcutta High Court on 
Wednesday directed West 
Bengal Police to constitute a 
Special Investigation Team 
(SIT) to probe the Mominpur 
incident.
After the investigation, 
the SIT will have to submit 
its report in court.
The Calcutta High Court 
has also directed the Kolkata Police Commissioner 
to take steps so that there is 
no further violence. 
Tensions flared up in Mominpur on Sunday after 
religious flags put up in the 
area for the Milad-un-Nabi 
festival were allegedly torn 
up, which soon turned 
violent with the vandalization of several vehicles and 
shops. Reports said a group 
of people later in the night 
surrounded the Ekbalpore 
police station in protest 
against the violence and 
demanded the arrest of the 
accused. Some police personnel have been 
reportedly injured. Security has 
been tightened in the area 
since then.
The West Bengal Police on 
Monday imposed section 
144 in the Ekbalpur area 
of the state for two days. 
The two-day curfew (from 
October 10 to October 12), 
has been imposed amid the 
ongoing law and order situation in the region due to the 
violence that erupted in Mominpur and the ransacking 
of Ekbalpur police station 
on Sunday evening.

Kannada Rastra Telangana 
Association (KRTA) extended support to 
the Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao’s recently 
launched national party Bharat Rastra Samithi (BRS). 
Speaking to the press at Bengaluru’s Press Club on Friday, 
KRTA President Sundeep 
Kumar Makthala said that the 
BRS will emerge as a strong 
alternative to the BJP and 
Congress at the national level. 
Makthala, along with KRTA 
Secretary General E.V. Satish 
Kumar and other members 
of the Association detailed 
the programmes of the Association. Makthala said that 
the Janata Dal (S) had allocated land for the Telangana 
Bhavan at Bengaluru after 
successful representation by 
the KRTA. The TRS party 
then, had also extended sup
port for the construction of the 
Telangana Bhavan.
KRTA was formed in 2012 
to protect the interests of people from Telangana living in 
Karnataka besides promoting 
Telangana festivals and culture in Karnataka.  KRTA 
organises various events as part 
of its promotion of Telangana 
culture in Karnataka. These 
programmes are attended by 
scores of people from Telangana living in various parts of
Karnataka. Also, people from 
Seemandhra attend these 
programmes and present an 
example of unity and brotherhood in Karnataka. 
Leaders from Congress, BJP 
and JDS attend the cultural 
programmes organised by 
the KRTA in Bengaluru every year. They hailed the ser- 
vices of KRTA led by Sundeep 
Kumar in taking up various 
initiatives for the Telangana 
community in Karnataka. 
The KRTA team led by Sundeep Makthala presented a 
memorandum to the Chief 
Secretary of Karnataka Ratna 
Prabha to take up construction of Telangana Bhavan in 
Karnataka in 2017.
In 2018, during the Assembly election, KRTA met rep- 
resentatives of various political parties and urged them to 
include construction of Telangana Bhavan in Karnataka in 
their poll manifesto.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on 
Friday claimed that drugs worth 
Rs 900 crore were seized and 
a total of 6,800 people have 
been arrested in the state since 
May 2021.
“To make Assam a drug-free 
state, the Assam government 
is continuing its war against 
Drugs. Drugs worth Rs 900 
crore seized and 6,800 persons arrested in Assam since 
May 2021,” said CM Himanta 
Biswa Sarma during his address at the Srimanta 
Sankardev Kalakshetra in Guwahati. The Assam Police on 
August 2 seized a huge quantity of narcotic drugs worth Rs 
15 crore in the Karbi Anglong 
district during a joint operation with CRPF, while on July 
15, the police seized a huge
quantity of contraband drugs 
worth Rs 3 crore from a drug 
peddler in Karimganj.
The said programme was 
also attended by President 
Droupadi Murmu, who was 
on her maiden visit to the state 
after she assumed office in the 
national capital.
Earlier in the morning, 
President Murmu visited the 
shaktipeeth Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati accompanied 
by CM Sarma and Governor 
Jagdish Mukhi and offered 
prayers while seeking blessings for everyone’s well-being 
and welfare. “Honoured to 
accompany Hon’ble President 
Smt Droupadi Murmj ji, who 
is on a 2-day visit to Assam, to 
the Kamakhya Temple along 
with Hon’ble Governor Prof 
Jagdish Mukhi. We sought 
blessings from Maa Kamakhya and 
prayed for the wellbeing and welfare of 
every-one,” Assam CM tweeted after 
the temple visit. On the first 
day of her visit (Thursday), 
President Murmu inaugurated a Supercomputer 
facility in Param Kamrupa and 
the facility for the design and 
development of high-power 
microwave components at 
IIT Guwahati; Medical College and Hospital at Dhubri.

The National Investigation Agency 
(NIA) on Friday conducted searches at multiple locations including 
the Poonch district in Jammu and 
Kashmir in connection with a drone 
delivery case.
According to the NIA, no detentions in the matter have been made so  
far. In the past nine months, security 
forces have observed the illegal entry of 191 drones into Indian territory 
from neighbouring Pakistan, raising 
major concerns in terms of internal 
security in the country.
The central government recently 
shared the input from the security 
forces deployed at the India-Pakistan  
border to maintain such illegal attempts from the Pakistan side. 
In the early hours today, troops of 
the Border Security Force (BSF) shot 
down a drone that entered India in 
Punjab’s Gurdaspur sector from the 
Pakistan side on the International 
Border.
It is pertinent to mention that in 
the past nine months the army personnel have observed 191 drones, of 
which 171 entered into Indian territory through the India-Pakistan 
border along the Punjab sector while 
20 were seen in the Jammu sector, 
a document accessed by the ANI
mentioned. As per the document, the  
“UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) 
observation in Indo-Pak border was 
seen in Punjab and Jammu frontier 
with effect from January 1, 2022, to 
September 30, 2022”.
The document further revealed 
that most of these drones or UAVs 
managed to flee while a total of seven 
have been shot down by the Border 
Security Force (BSF) personnel, who 
have been deployed along the India-Pakistan border to keep a tab on such  
illegal activities being orchestrated 
by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence. Officials in the BSF told ANI 
that the drones are being used by 
Pakistan’s side to transport weapons, 
explosives and narcotics across the 
international border in Jammu and 
Punjab from Pakistan.
The increased drone activity across 
the border was brought to the notice 
of Union Home Minister Amit Shah 
in the security review meeting in 
Srinagar recently with top security 
and intelligence chiefs in attendance. 
While BSF, which means the international border with Pakistan in the 
Jammu sector, believes that it has 
been able to repel drones carrying 
arms, ammunition and explosives 
from Pakistan, the state police and 
the intelligence agencies differ with 
this assessment.

*
very Chinese leadership since the time 
of Mao Zedong has 
come up with its own foreign 
policy conceptualization after conducting a thorough 
stock-taking of the existing 
international security situation. This year, in April 22, 
in the backdrop of escalating 
Russia-Ukraine conflict and 
continuing menace of Covid-19 pandemic, Xi Jinping 
put forward a Global Security Initiative (GSI) which is 
basically a framework for 
achieving global peace. But 
the interesting part is while 
he championed for global 
peace, he also spelt out the 
need for making Asia “the 
anchor for world peace, 
a powerhouse for global 
growth and a new pacesetter for international 
cooperation.” This is also reminiscent of a similar proposition 
made at the CICA Shanghai 
Summit of May 2014 where 
Xi for the first time proposed 
a New Asian Security Concept and called for creating 
an Asian security Forum 
for the Asians alone. Arguably, in all his speeches and 
foreign policy positions, the 
singular feature that dominates is anti-US rhetoric and 
the need for global cooperation in thwarting US 
hegemonism. In other words, 
the existence of the US as the 
principal enemy is the necessary criterion for China’s 
formulation of foreign policy. 
Moreover, the conceptualisation of GSI follows his 
earlier visions of national 
security about which he 
had himself penned in an 
article for Xinhua on November 15, 2013. In it, he wrote 
that China faced ‘double 
pressure’, one from the outside and the other from the 
home front. Painting a grim 
security scenario, his article 
served as the backgrounder 
for the formation of the Central National Security 
Commission (CNSC) in January 
2014 and conceptualization 
of Comprehensive National 
Security (CNS) in April 
of the same year. There is 
thus, not only a regular assessment on the prevailing 
global security situation, but 
more significantly, in all the 
security assessments there 
is a predominant emphasis 
on threat perceptions.  This 
is most vivid in Xi Jinping’s 
categorisation of the types of 
security in the CNS concept.  
Originally, the CNS had 
mentions of 11 types of security which was later 
expanded to 16, thus scornfully 
dubbed as “securitization 
of everything” political, 
military, homeland security, 
economic, cultural, social, 
technological, cyberspace, 
ecological, resource, nuclear, overseas interests, outer 
space, deep sea, polar, and 
biological security. This obsession about securitising 
everything also suggests 
deep insecurity that the party suffers from. Further, Xi 
has assigned hierarchy of security types with political 
security, that is, safeguarding 
China’s party state, acquired 
the highest priority. This 
mind boggling and micro 
analysis of the security environment raises questions 
about the rationale for such 
an assessment of security. 
Of course, resisting and 
marginalizing the US has 
been a primary objective of 
China and a long term goal 
since the time of Mao. There 
is also nothing uncommon 
about countries framing 
their foreign policies premised on the external 
security environment and for the 
purposes of preservation of 
national security and promotion of national interests. 
But when China takes stock 
of the external security situation, its overwhelming focus 
is on the nature of the threat. 
That explains why it categorises security into 16 broad 
types. Plus, it measures the 
intensity of the security type 
to come up with  appropriate strategies to respond to 
them. That China assigns 
political security as the 
number one security concern, suggests that it has the 
greatest threat perceptions 
emanating from the domestic arena. No wonder 
therefore, the People’s Armed 
Police (PAP), a paramilitary 
force designed for stability 
maintenance and internal 
security, has emerged to become the dominant player 
today in the national security arena. So much so that in 
2018, it was brought under 
the full authority of the Central Military Commission, 
the highest military organ of 
China. Earlier, it was under 
the dual control of the Ministry of Public Security and 
the CMC. As regards the 
budgetary allocations, there 
have been reports of China 
spending more on the PAP 
than on the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Further, 
in Chinese memory and 
threat perceptions, the fall 
of the Soviet Union is considered most catastrophic. 
Because the Soviet collapse 
was internally induced, not 
externally driven. Also, a 
reading of its imperial history suggests that most 
dynasties were brought 
down by internal rebellion 
and domestic unrest rather 
than foreign invasions. So, 
internal threat perceptions 
are deeply embedded in the 
Chinese psyche. 
For China, thus, the domestic arena serves as the 
primary referent for formulating national security 
policy. This is all the more true 
for authoritarian countries 
like China whose legitimacy 
and authority do not emanate from democratic elec- 
tions but from economic performance which is the only 
path for ensuring  domestic 
prosperity and well-being of 
the masses. But when Xi Jinping became the president of 
China, he confronted shrill 
cries of deglobalization and 
protectionism rising from 
the West that critically hurt 
its developmental goals. 
Plus, at this time, there was 
also rising US’ trade war 
against China. All this was 
perceived by the Chinese 
leadership as sure signs of 
the West conspiring to derail 
China’s path to global power. 
The onset of Covid-19 pandemics further vitiated the 
prospects of global trade and 
investment opportunities. 
Countries across the world 
called for decoupling from 
China and diversifying the 
supply chains. And finally, 
came the Russian invasion 
of Ukraine on 24th February 
that spelt a doom for global 
peace and development. All 
this amounted to shaking 
Chinese Communist authority because the crux of 
Chinese problems was just 
one: shrinking economic 
developmental prospects 
that spells doom for party 
legitimacy. 
It is in this context, Xi Jinping proposed the GSI. And 
the preeminent theme that 
dots his speeches on the 
promotion of GSI in several 
world fora, such as the recent Shanghai Cooperation 
the daily guardian review 
saturday 15 october 2022
new delhi comment & analysis
Explaining China’s Siege Mentality
Organization Summit meeting in September, is that the 
Western world and primarily the US has ganged up 
against China and conspired 
to derail its rise. Therefore, 
domestically, Xi Jinping has 
responded to this crisis by 
tightening his grip on the 
party, which means ideology 
has returned into the Communist body polity. Notably, 
the function of ideology is to 
keep the enemy alive. The 
presence of the enemy, the 
‘other’, is the only path to 
sustain the self. 
Perpetuating the image 
of a conspiratorial West is, 
thus, vital for sustenance 
of the CCP. This suggests 
threat perceptions are the 
basis for Chinese foreign 
policy formulation. And 
when threat is the primary 
referent, insecurity is a natural outcome. And this 
insecurity pushes China into 
adopting a collision course 
in the international arena. 
This is buttressed in Xi 
Jinping’s GSI proposal where 
the three-pronged steps to 
make Asia an anchor for 
world peace actually ends 
up in bifurcating the world 
into Asia and non-Asia. In 
sum, Xi Jinping’s GSI is neither a recipe for promotion 
of global peace nor it has elements for the creation of an 
alternative global security 
architecture. The GSI is then 
meant for Chinese domestic 
consumption to shore up Xi’s 
domestic standing in the run 
up to the 20th Party Congress 
beginning this October16th.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is 
likely to have Roger Binny, a member of the 1983 
World Cup winning Squad as its next president. 
He shall succeed former India Skipper and Cricket 
icon Saurav Ganguly, who shall be completing his 
term shortly. When Binny assumes charge, it shall 
be for the first time, the Cricket body would have a 
World Cup winning player as its head. However, 
Ganguly’s contribution to the game as well as the 
manner in which he led from the front during his 
captaincy, cannot be minimized either. He has 
been one of the most popular players, who played 
the game with passion and also was candid both 
in his conversations and as an administrator. In 
fact, there are many sports commentators who 
are claiming that Ganguly did not get an 
extension since he did not campaign for the BJP in the 
West Bengal Assembly elections and thus earned 
the wrath of the Saffron Brigade which virtually 
controls the Board affairs now. The former India 
Captain had made it very clear that he would not 
be joining any political party and would therefore 
not campaign for any outfit either. It is 
difficult to believe that the BJP would stoop to such 
a level and deny the celebrated cricketer another 
term. The Board politics is very complex and it 
is likely that Ganguly got caught in it and had to 
leave. Many players believe that the reason for 
Virat Kohli giving up on Captaincy of all forms of the 
game was because he and Ganguly did not see eye 
to eye. Both have served their country with 
distinction and thus to attribute anything to either of 
them would be unfair. Yes, it is true that there was 
a controversy over the conversation which took 
place between the two and led to some uncharitable 
comments being made in cricket circles. Former 
India Coach Ravi Shastri, who also is not on 
the same page as Ganguly has welcomed the 
appointment of Binny as his successor. He said that 
Binny was the president of the Karnataka Cricket 
Association and therefore a natural choice. Al- 
though the change has taken place, yet one thing 
that is significant is that a former Test Player has 
been replaced by another former player and not by 
any politician or bureaucrat. The Board needs to 
be always headed by a Cricketer who understands 
the game and also knows about the problems both 
on the field as well as off it. One would have also 
liked to see the likes of Sunil Gavaskar, Rahul 
Dravid, Kapil Dev, MS Dhoni or Sachin Tendulkar 
also heading the Board at some stage. The charge 
that BJP was making deep inroads into the cricket 
affairs has to be substantiated. Those in the Board 
must at all times only ensure that Cricket does 
not suffer. There was a time when the UPA was 
in power but the shots in the BCCI were called by 
former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. It is expected 
that Binny would bring in his experience and 
wide understanding of the game to take Cricket 
forward in this country.

The election dates for the 
Gujarat Legislative Assem- 
bly will be announced soon. 
The elections will not only 
affect the direction of India’s 
future politics but will also 
affect the socio-economic 
conditions and foreign 
capital investment. As Chief 
Minister and then Prime 
Minister, Narendra Modi, 
BJP and allies have given 
huge benefits of socio-economic 
transformation to the 
people. These are expected 
to benefit the BJP in the 
upcoming elections as well. 
But after being 27 years 
in power in the state, how 
much strength still it 
possess, will Congress be able 
to survive and how formidable will be the Aam Aadmi 
Party are some questions 
that to be discussed threadbare. Congress’s ground has 
definitely weakened, but 
the grand old party’s roots 
are deep. The AAP is overly 
optimistic about the success 
of Punjab and is hoping for 
a miracle victory in Gujarat 
too.
The biggest impact of 
Gujarat’s election results 
will be on the next year’s 
2023 elections in the neighbouring states of Rajast- 
han, Madhya Pradesh and 
Chhattisgarh. The question 
is whether a state like Gujarat is satisfied with its past 
performance of progress,
or it would go whole heartedly on future plans on 
economic development. Will it 
harp on caste equations or 
populist measures? There 
are many traps lying ahead. 
In the last two decades, 
the fact is that Gujarat has 
outperformed the country 
on many economic param- 
eters. Gujarat is a state with 
only 5% of the total population of the country, but its 
share of the country’s economic development is much 
higher than others. With a 
growth rate of $ 216.74 billion in 2020–2021, India 
has contributed 8.36% to 
the $2.59 trillion economy. 
Meaning, Gujarat has become the fifth largest state in 
terms of its share of India’s GDP. 
Now Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target 
of a 5 trillion dollar economy. Gujarat’s politics, 
future government and rapid 
development in neighbouring states will also have an 
impact on the Lok Sabha elections to be held in 2024. 
In this election, the AAP is trying to make 
education and health the main 
issues. Whereas Gujarat is 
currently ranked fourth in 
the country in the quality 
of school education and the 
second largest university state in the country with 
more than 100 universities. 
Gujarat is the first state to 
implement the New Education Policy 2020. Similarly, 
in the field of health and 
wellness, the state has been 
honoured first place several times at the national 
level. Nevertheless, with 
the expansion of modern 
education, technology, and 
medical facilities, dreams 
of rapid economic progress 
are being realised in cities as 
well as remote rural and regional areas. The real 
political test is in rural and tribal 
areas. Once Congress had 
stronghold in these areas. 
The BJP government has 
changed the condition of 
agriculture by bringing waperspective 
CriCket gameplan 
ter from Narmada. People 
have been rejuvenated by 
giving subsidies for houses, 
domestic gas, Ayushman 
Bharat, agriculture etc. So it 
has to be seen how satisfied 
the people are and whether 
the AAP is able to extend its 
influence to the villages. 
The vote percentage 
between the BJP and Congress 
in Gujarat during the last 
few years has been around 
40-50. Committed votes 
remain between 35 and 36 
percent. But the BJP is winning more and more seats. 
In direct competition, not 
only Gujarat but states like 
Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh have 
to face more challenges. 
From this point of view, the 
BJP can get an indirect benefit of getting a few votes in 
spite of spoiling the atmosphere due to the very toxic 
election campaign of the 
AAP. In cities like Surat and 
Baroda, the hope of support 
for the party was seen from 
the crowd that came to see Arvind Kejriwal. 
As a result of previous 
experience, victory and defeat are not decided by the 
crowds at election rallies, and they cannot be the sole 
basis of votes. Similarly, new parties have been debcci

the previous defence line, 
preparations for the election 
contest are being made with 
the help of volunteers from 
the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. But elections are 
no less than an ordeal. This 
election going to be held at 
the end of the year, the result and effect of this 
election will be seen in 2023.

he Varanasi Court 
has rejected a petition 
moved by the Hindu 
worshippers seeking a scientific investigation into ‘Shiva 
Linga’, reportedly found inside the Gyanvapi Mosque 
premises.
However, the Hindu worshippers had sought a 
scientific investigation to determine the age of the structure 
in question ‘Shiva Linga’ (as claimed by the Hindu worshippers). 
Further, it may 
be noted that the Anjuman 
Masjid committee has been 
calling the structure in question as ‘Fauwara/Fountain’ 
The District Judge AK 
Vishvesha rejected the petition filled by Hindu wor- 
shippers’ a after rejecting 
the objections of the Anjuman Intezamia Committee 
(which manages Gyanvapi 
mosque) objected to the 
plea moved by Hindu worshippers. 
The petition filled was rejected by the court in view of 
the Supreme Court’s order 
to protect the spot where 
a “shiv ling” was claimed 
to have been found during 
the survey of the Gyanvapi 
mosque.
Earlier, on October 7, it 
may be noted that the Varanasi Court had deferred 
the hearing on the plea after 
seeking clarifications from 
the parties on the following 
two points:
Whether the structure being found inside the 
Gyanvapi Mosque premises [alleged 
Shiva Linga] is a part of this 
suit property or not?
Can the court issue a commission for the purpose of 
scientific investigation? 
Before the Court, the counsels appearing for the Hindu 
Worshippers had submitted 
that the structure (‘Shiva Linga’) is a part of the suit 
case property as its original 
In Court pleadings state that the suit 
relates to visible or invisible 
deities and since the alleged 
Shiva Linga became visible 
during the court-appointed 
survey and the same would 
definitely be of a property 
suit.
Further, it has also been 
clarified that under Order 26 
Rule 10A of CPC, the Court 
has the power to the Court 
to issue a commission for 
scientific investigation. Thus, 
now the Mosque committee 
filed its reply in the matter. 
On October 11, the Anju- 
man Intezamia Committee 
(which manages Gyanvapi 
mosque) had objected to the 
demand of the Hindu wor
shippers seeking a scientific 
probe into the structure in
question.

The Supreme Court in the case Meena Devi 
vs Nunu Chand Mahto @ Nemchand Mahto 
observed and has stated that ‘just compensation’ 
exceeding claimed amount can be 
awarded in motor accident compensation 
claim cases.
The bench comprising of Justice Sanjiv 
Khanna and Justice JK Maheshwari observed 
that the Tribunal Court ought to 
award ‘just’ compensation which is reasonable 
in the facts relying upon the evidence 
produced on record.
In the present case, a twelve-year-old child, 
while playing in front of his house, was 
dashed by the Commander Jeep and while 
being taken to a hospital died on the way. 
Thus, a Claim Petition under Sections 140, 
166 read with Section 171 of Motor Vehicles 
Act, 1988 seeking compensation to the tune of 
Rs. 2,00,000/- with interest was filed by the 
mother of the deceased child. The compen- 
sation to the tune of Rs. 1,50,000/- in lump 
sum, has been granted by the Motor Accident 
Claims Tribunal granted. An appeal was 
made, wherein the High Court of Jharkhand 
at Ranchi enhanced the amount of compensation 
to Rs. 2,00,000 equivalent to the 
value of the claim made in the Claim Petition. 
Thereafter, the mother-claimant approached the Apex Court contending that 
MACT and the High Court have not granted 
any amount under the head “loss of prospective 
happiness” and other conventional heads 
and the amount being granted under the 
head of loss of dependencies is inadequate. 
Further, the valuation of claim is immaterial 
to grant just and reasonable compensation. 
An error has been committed by restricting
he compensation equal to valuation of Claim
It had been noted by the Court that the 
deceased was a brilliant student and studying 
in a private school. Further, the court noticed 
in the case Kishan Gopal and another vs. Lala 
and others, wherein the compensation has 
been calculated treating Rs. 30,000/- as 
notional income which includes the future 
prospects in place of Rs. 15,000/- as being 
specified in the IInd Schedule of the M.V. 
Act and applying the multiplier as specified 
in the judgment in the case Sarla Verma & 
Others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and 
Another. The court stated and while applying 
the said decision, the court enhanced the 
amount of compensation to 5,00,000/-. 
The Court stated that it is necessary to clarify 
that as per the decision of a Three-Judge 
Bench of this Court in Nagappa vs. Gurdayal 
Singh and others, wherein it was observed 
that under the MV Act, there is no restriction 
that the Tribunal/Court cannot award 
compensation exceeding the amount so claimed. 
Further, the Tribunal/Court ought to award 
‘just’ compensation which is reasonable in 
the facts relying upon the evidence produced 
on record. It stated that less valuation, 
if any, made in the Claim Petition would not 
be impediment to award just compensation 
exceeding the claimed amount.

The Supreme Court in the 
case Central Warehouse 
Corporation vs Adani Ports 
Special Economic Zone Limited (APSEZL), while setting 
aside the Gujarat High Court 
order observed that it is surprised with the observations 
made by the High Court in 
the case.
The bench comprising 
of Justice BR Gavai and 
Justice CT Ravikumar observed and has stated that 
the approach of the High 
Court ought to have been a 
balanced one and that the 
settlement could not have 
been thrust upon that of a 
statutory corporation to its 
detriment and to the advantage of a private entity. 
In the present case, the 
Gujarat High Court had 
effectively allowed Adani 
Ports Special Economic 
Zone Ltd (APSEZL) to acquire 34 acres of land 
adjacent to Mundra Port in 
Gujarat if the CWC failed to 
obtain approval or waiver 
of its warehousing facility 
as an SEZ-compliant unit 
within the period of three 
months. Thus, aggrieved 
with this order, the CWC 
approached the Apex Court 
contending that the order 
of the High Court is almost 
thrusting a part of the settlement on the CWC.
The bench observed that 
when an issue involved 
the balancing of interests 
of a statutory corporation 
and a private company, the 
High Court approach ought 
to have been a balance one. 
However, the High Court 
ought to have taken into 
consideration that, unless 
all the three conditions 
were complied with and 
the interest of the appellant-CWC, which is a statutory 
corporation, could not have 
been safeguarded. Therefore, if a settlement was to 
be arrived at, unless the 
same was found to be in the 
interest of both the parties 
and it could not have been 
thrust upon that of a statutory corporation to its 
detriment and to the advantage 
of a private entity. 
Accordingly, the bench set 
aside the High Court order.

The National Company Law 
Tribunal, NCLT, Hyderabad Bench, has 
been reconstituted vide a Circular 
dated 11.10.2022 and from 
20.10.2022 onwards, the 
changes are applicable till 
further orders. The NCLT 
new Hyderabad Benches 
shall comprise of:
First Half: NCLT Hyderabad, Court Room No. 1 
Judicial Member, Dr. Venkata Ramakrishna 
Badarinath Nandula
Technical Member, Shri 
Ajai Das Mehrotra
Second Half: NCLT Hyderabad, Court Room No. 2 
Judicial Member, Dr. Venkata Ramakrishna Badarinath Nandula
Technical Member, Shri 
Satya Ranjan Prasad 
Thus, the Circular has 
been issued in partial modification of Order of even 
number dated 24.08.2022 
and is applicable from 
20.10.2022 till further orders. Further, the 
reconstituted Bench shall take up 
matters through Video Conferencing. Background
The recent reconstitution 
has been done in view of the 
retirement of fifteen NCLT 
Members on 03.07.2022. 
Thus, 23 NCLT Members 
has been appointed by Ministry of Corporate Affairs 
vide a notification dated 
20.09.2019 (“Notification”) 
for a term of 3 years or till 
the age of 65 years, which- 
ever is earlier. It is been prescribed under Section 413 
of the Companies Act, 2013, 
the term of the Members as 
5 years.
It had been observed that 
the Central Government had 
granted extension of tenure 
to eight out of the twenty-three Members appointed 
through the Notification, 
while the remaining Members retired on 03.07.2022. 
At present, the total strength 
of NCLT Members was forty-five, which came down 
to thirty on 03.07.2022 and 
thus created a shortage of 
Members.
A writ petition has been 
filled by National Company 
Law Tribunal Bar Association (“NCLTBA”), the case 
titled as National Company 
Law Tribunal Bar Association v Union of India before 
the Supreme Court in May 
2022, wherein seeking 
modification of the term of 
3 years fixed by the MCA 
Notification as 5 years. On 
20.06.2022., in a hearing 
held, the Supreme Court 
opined that the appointees 
had accepted the three 
years period of appointment in 2019 without any 
demur and had till date did 
not raise any challenges 
against the same. It had been 
declined by the Supreme 
Court to grant any interim 
relief and in a subsequent 
hearing held on 01.08.2022 
and the plea of the NCLTBA 
for extension of tenure of the 
NCLT Members has been 
turned down by the Supreme Court, while 
observing that NCLTBA should be 
interested in filling up of vacancies of Members rather 
than their tenure. 
Further, Several NCLT 
Benches have been re-constituted, Special Benches 
have been constituted and 
hearings are being conducted through video 
conferencing to meet the shortage 
of Members. The Ministry 
of Corporate Affairs has 
released notification for appointment of new Members 
to NCLT.

bitral tribunal as sufficient and efficient. In the 
case of Uttarakhand Purv 
Sainik Kalyan Nigam Ltd. 
v. Northern Coal Field Ltd, 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court, 
while examining this backbone principle applied this 
principle and held that “the 
dispute related to the arbitrability should be decided 
by the tribunal itself and 
courts can interfere only 
when there is no agreement 
at all or whether the consent 
to enter into an agreement is 
vitiated by fraud or misrepresentation.” Hence, under 
the said Act, the challenge 
before a court is maintainable only after the final 
award is passed as provided 
by sub-section (6) of Section 
16. In the case of N.N. Global 
Mercantile v. Indo Unique 
Flame Ltd, similar footings 
were observed while dealing with the said principle. 
Interestingly, in Kvaerner 
Cementation India Limited v. Bajranglal Agarwal, it 
was held that the civil court 
do not have the jurisdiction 
to interfere in arbitral matters, owing to the principle 
of Kompetenz-Kompetenz 
which focuses on the competence of a court.
Quite recently, the Calcutta 
High Court denied the contention of forum non 
conveniens while restraining 
the other party from taking
steps for a London-seated 
arbitration while reiterating 
that the contract was signed 
cautiously. Similarly, in Sancorp Confectionary v. 
Gumlik, the Delhi High Court 
Maharashtra State Mining 
Corporation (MSMC) and 
Vidarbha Economic Development Council have jointly 
organized this conference at 
Nagpur. Union Minister for 
Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari pre- 
sided over this conference. 
Maharashtra State Forest 
and Environment Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, 
Maharashtra Government 
Minerals Minister Dadaji 
Bhuse, Principal Secretary 
of Commerce Department 
Harshdeep Kamble, President of the Maharashtra 
Mining Corporation Ashish Jaiswal, President of the 
Vidarbha Economic Development Council Devendra 
Parikh also attended this 
conference.
Shri Joshi further informed that the value of 
mineral wealth in India was 
Rs 1.9 lakh crore in 2021-22. 
The Government is committed to its appropriate utili- 
zation and distribution, he 
added. He said that the Vidarbha region’s role will 
remain important in developing India as a 5 trillion dollar 
economy. He further said that the Union government 
will always extend complete support for new ideas and 
new research, and also provide necessary incentives. 
Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said that the foundation of the Vidarbha region’s 
development is based on 
mining and forest, and only 
mining-based industries 
can accelerate the progress 
of the Vidarbha region. He 
said that the Vidarbha region has 75% of mineral 
and 80% of the forest resources of Maharashtra and 
proper utilization of these 
will increase the Vidarbha 
region’s share in the energy 
sector. He further said that 
more investment in water,
energy and communication 
is necessary to make India 
self-sufficient along with a 5 
trillion dollar economy. Stating that coal production has 
increased due to the radical 
changes made by the Central Government in the 
mining sector, Shri Gadkari said 
that India’s energy needs are
increasing and more coal 
will be needed in the future. 
Only Vidarbha region can 
fulfill this need, he added. 
Following the Centre, the 
State Governments should 
also save time by using 
modern working systems, Nitin 
Gadkari said. He urged the 
state governments to provide the required licenses 
for these sectors at the earliest with emphasis on time 
planning and transparency. 
These sectors should reduce 
the country’s urea import of 
Rs. 60 thousand crores by 
producing ammonium nitrate and urea from coal. He 
further suggested that these 
sectors should now formulate new policies to reduce 
fuel imports of Rs 17 lakh 
crore. He said that the steps 
have to be taken now for the 
closed mines and if the mine 
is not economically viable, 
the policies will have to be 
relaxed.
Shri Gadkari also said that 
the country needs 6 million 
tonnes of manganese and 
Vidarbha region should 
take the initiative to fulfill it. 
He also suggested that the 
mining industry and investors should come together to 
find a solution for a royalty 
based on the market price 
of coal. The Union Road 
Transport and Highways 
Minister said that transparency, timely functioning and 
corruption-free processes 
are very much necessary 
for the mining sector, and 
assured that he will strive 
for proper coordination and 
communication between 
the concerned ministers and 
officials of all departments 
for the new coal mining in 
the Vidarbha region. 
Officials of various government organizations and 
investors in the mining and 
mineral sector are participating in this conference 
organized between October 
14-16, 2022.

Tarun Nanga

As Deepika Padukone talked about 
her depression on 
the sets of Amitabh Bachchan’s programme Kaun 
Banega Crorepati, everyone 
lauded her courage. Actors Tiger Shroff, Anushka 
Sharma and Varun Dhawan were also praised for 
their courage when they 
openly admitted that they 
too suffered from depression at some point in time 
and needed treatment. Just 
imagine what is the condition of the common man 
in this country in terms of 
mental health.
You might be wondering why I am talking about 
mental health this time in 
my column. Actually, today, 
October 10, is World Mental 
Health Day. Mental Health 
Day was celebrated for the 
first time in 1992 at the initiative of the World Health 
Organisation. It has been 30 
years since and what have 
we achieved? The first step 
in the mental health problem is stress. We all know 
that with time the stress in 
life keeps increasing. This 
stress later makes people 
suffer from depression. 
According to the official 
statistics, about 5.60 crore 
people are suffering from 
depression and about 3.8 
crore people are suffering 
from anxiety-related disorders. In my view, these are 
mere statistics. The reality 
is, be it a celebrity, a rich, or 
a common man, everyone 
is a victim of stress in some 
form or the other. Does 
Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi not have stress? Do 
Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee or Arvind Kejriwal, 
or Amitabh Bachchan have 
no stress? In fact, stress is in 
proportion to the responsibility you hold. But the most 
important thing is how you 
deal with it and how you 
manage your life.
One cannot pinpoint 
any single cause for stress. 
There can be several reasons. Most of the time, 
stress stems from one’s own 
problems. Some people 
get stressed even over the 
smallest things. Other people are the ones who are the 
victims of jealousy and get 
stressed by seeing the progress of others and the third 
reason is systemic. Our lives 
are largely influenced by the 
existing system. The flaws 
in that system also cause a 
lot of stress. Although a lot 
has changed in the government offices now, are we still 
able to do as hassle-free a 
transaction as we want to? If 
you want a certificate from a 
government office, you will 
have to run from pillar to 
post. Right from procuring 
ration from a ration shop to 
getting treatment in a government hospital or getting 
some other work done, they 
all cause stress. Whenever 
a girl goes to the market, 
her mother remains under stress until she returns 
analysIs
home! It is therefore clear 
that to make life stress free, 
the social, government and 
private systems will have to 
be streamlined. Otherwise, 
the stress will keep mounting.
I get restless seeing the 
condition of children. 
Barely do they turn 6 when 
they are thrown into the 
cobweb of stress. Parents 
crib like: Look at that child. 
Why can’t you score marks 
as well as he/she does? Or, 
this child sings so well, so 
why can’t you? This stress 
analysIs
caused by the parents’ expectations has deprived the 
children of their childhood. 
In the midst of all this, not 
only the children but their 
parents too fall prey to 
stress. All this stress accumulates and takes a dangerous form.
Yet, there are people in society who do not suffer from 
any stress at all. They obtain 
loans and forget. Some people take loans worth lakhs 
and crores of rupees from 
the banks and run away 
abroad. Even if such people 
stay in the country, they de- 
clare themselves bankrupt. 
Even after going bankrupt, 
they lead a luxurious life 
with an airplane at their disposal. Whereas if a farmer 
wants a loan to buy a cow, 
he will be asked if he knows 
how to milk the cow or 
not. But to give a loan of Rs 
50 crore to someone, only 
one phone call is enough. 
Such acts also cause stress 
to the common man. Let 
me give you two examples. 
Renowned cardiologist Dr 
Nityanand alias Neetu Mandke was building a hospital 
in Mumbai. But due to the 
problems he was facing in 
constructing the same, he 
suffered an attack in his 
car and could not be saved. 
Similarly, a boy was going 
for an interview by bus. The 
bus got stuck in traffic. This 
made him anxious that he 
would not be able to reach 
for the interview in time. 
Due to this stress, he got an 
attack and died on the bus 
itself. That is to say, staying 
stress-free is not solely in 
your hands. The common 
man will be stress-free only 
when the whole environment will be so.
I can say on the basis of 
my experience that the Indian way of life is the best to 
control stress. If we include 
yoga and meditation in our 
life sincerely, there will 
definitely be relief in stress 
management. Modern science also accepts it, but in 
the hustle-bustle of life, 
most people are forgetting 
it. Remember that all our 
great leaders Mahatma 
Gandhi, Pandit Nehru, In- 
dira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, 
or Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi practised yoga and 
sadhana. And that is why 
they never got tired even after working for 16 hours! 
Know your cultural heritage. Be balanced. Be in the 
midst of those who laugh 
and make others laugh. Be 
cool and busy. Do it and you 
will definitely be successful in keeping stress away. 
Remember the old saying: 
Where there is a will there 
is a way!

Tesla CEO Elon Musk 
is being investigated 
by the US federal authorities in connection with 
his USD 44 billion Twitter 
buyout deal, said media reports, citing a court filing by 
the microblogging site. 
However, the Thursday 
Twitter court filing did not 
go into details of the ongoing probe as to what actions 
taken by the business magnate are being investigated 
by the officials. In the court 
filing, Twitter, without delving into details of the matter, 
simply said that they are 
looking into Musk’s “conduct” linked to the deal. The 
main focus seems to be on 
Musk’s legal team. 
Twitter accused Musk’s 
legal team of failing to produce draught communica- 
tions with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission 
and a slide presentation to 
the Federal Trade Commission. This is part of the two 
sides’ ongoing litigation over 
whether Musk can walk 
away from the deal. 
Reacting to the Twitter filing, Musk’s attorney Alex 
Spiro said that the filing only 
aims to digress from its own 
legal issues, which came to 
the surface through whistleblower disclosure. Peiter 
Zatko, the former Twitter security chief, accused 
Twitter of wrongdoing last 
month, including “Twitter’s 
tracking and measurement 
of user engagement.” 
“Twitter’s executives are 
under federal investiga 
tion,” Spiro said in a statement “. This misdirection 
was sent by Twitter to try 
and uncover which of their 
assorted misconduct they 
are under investigation for.” 
In July, in a surprising turn 
of events, Elon Musk, who 
had long been showing his 
interest in buying Twitter, 
terminated the deal. The 
Tesla CEO did so by alleging 
that Twitter violated their 
mutual purchase agreement by misrepresenting the 
number of spam and fake bot 
accounts on its platform. 
After Musk put out the 
deal termination announcement, the market saw a 
sharp decline. Later, Twitter 
sued Musk accusing him of 
using bots as a pretext to exit 
a deal.

Russian President Vladimir 
Putin on Thursday suggested a “gas hub” plan to his 
Turkish counterpart Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan and added 
that if Turkey is interested, 
then they would consider its 
feasibility. 
 “If there is interest from 
Turkey and our potential 
buyers from other countries, we could consider 
the possibility of building 
another gas pipeline system and creating a gas hub 
in Turkey to sell to other 
countries to third countries, 
primarily, of course, the European ones, if they are 
interested,” Putin said on the 
sidelines of the Conference 
on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures 
in Asia summit in Astana, 
Kazakhstan. Putin further 
added that if the proposal 
goes ahead, it will not only 
be the platform of supply 
but will also determine 
prices. “These prices are 
outrageous today.”We could 
calmly regulate [them] at a 
normal market level without any political overtones,” 
he said.
Earlier on Wednesday, Putin mentioned the prospect 
of a gas hub based in Turkey during Russia’s energy 
summit in Moscow, saying 
Russia could redirect supplies intended for the 
damaged Nord Stream pipelines 
to the Black Sea to create it. 
“We could move the lost 
volumes from the Nord 
Streams along the bottom of the Baltic Sea to the 
Black Sea region and thus 
make the main routes for 
the supply of our fuel and 
our natural gas to Europe 
through Turkey, thus creating the largest gas hub for 
Europe in Turkey,” Putin 
said. “That is, of course, if 
our partners are interested 
in this and economic feasibility, of course.” 
Meanwhile, at the CICA 
summit, Putin said that 
Afghanistan remains one 
of the biggest security challenges in Asia and insisted 
on using the resources of 
the Shanghai Cooperation 
Organisation and its regional anti-terrorist body 
to normalise the situation 
in the country.
Putin made the remarks 
during the 6th summit of the 
CICA, which is taking place 
in Astana, Kazakhstan. 
The President of Russia 
also invited all the Asian 
countries to engage in 
closer cooperation with the 
International Counter-Terrorist Data Bank, which 
was established at Russia’s 
initiative at the CICA Summit, the official statement 
of the President of Russia 
stated. The Russian President also took a sharp dig 
at US’s withdrawal from 
Afghanistan following the 
Taliban’s takeover and said 
that Afghanistan was unable to independently deal 
with the terrorist threat 
even after 20 years of the 
presence of the US and 
NATO as blasts continue to 
take place in the war-torn 
nation.

The head of the Ukrainian 
grid operator, Ukrenergo, 
said that the power has been 
largely restored following 
this week’s Russian strikes 
on the country. 
On Monday, Russia 
launched several missiles 
at Kyiv and several other 
Ukrainian cities, which 
killed at least 14 people and 
wounded 97 others, CNN 
reported, citing the Ukrainian State Emergency Service. On national television, 
Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, 
Chief Executive Officer of 
Ukrenergo, said that some 
repair work was continuing on damaged 
infrastructure but supplies had been 
restored. 
Despite this, Ukrainians 
should continue to conserve energy as there is the 
possibility of Russian attacks on energy facilities, 
he added. 
In Monday’s attack, the 
strikes knocked out the 
power in the regions of 
Kyiv, Lviv, Sumy, Ternopil, 
and Khmelnytsky. 
According to the General 
Staff of the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine, Russia launched 
more than 84 missiles and 
air strikes. Ukraine claimed 
it intercepted 56 of the missiles and drones. The mili- 
tary said around 20 Ukrainian settlements were hit. 
Earlier on Saturday, at least 
17 people were killed and 
40 others injured after a 
rocket struck Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia area.
In the attack, Acting Mayor of Zaporizhzhia Anatoly 
Kurtev said that five houses 
were destroyed and apartment buildings were damaged. While addressing the 
nation on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that a 
fierce battle is taking place 
around the city of Bakhmut 
in the eastern Donetsk region.
“We are holding positions 
in Donbas, in particular in 
the Bakhmut direction, 
where now it is very, very 
hard, very tough fighting,”. 
“Today, I would like to once 
again mention our soldiers 
from the Kholodny Yar 
93rd Separate Mechanized 
Brigade for their courage 
and sustained power in this 
direction.” Zaporizhzhia is 
a major city in southern 
Ukraine, not far from the 
front line, and the site of a 
nuclear power plant that 
the international community is watching warily. 
Notably, the war between 
Moscow and Kyiv intensifies after Russia announced 
the annexation of four regions of Ukraine Donetsk, 
Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia 
and Kherson regions.

Hours after several rockets 
struck Baghdad’s Green 
Zone, the Iraqi Parliament 
elected Kurdish politician 
Abdul Latif Rashid as the 
country’s new president, 
ending the country’s political deadlock. 
The newly elected president 
has replaced fellow Iraqi 
Kurd Barham Saleh as head 
of state after the two-round 
vote in parliament on Thursday, winning more than 160 
votes against 99 for Saleh, 
Al Jazeera reported, citing 
an assembly official. Rashid, 
78, was the Iraqi minister of 
water resources from 2003 
to 2010 and is a British-educated engineer. 
A first round of voting on 
the presidential nomination 
failed to reach the required 
two-thirds majority. Iraq has 
made three failed attempts 
this year to elect a new head 
of state from February 7 to 
March 30. 
Iraqi lawmakers reconvened in the afternoon after 
a quorum was reached to 
postpone the session, with 
at least 269 of the 329 members attending the session. 
A first round of voting on 
the presidential nomination 
resulted in a failure to reach 
the required two-thirds majority. A second round was 
underway. 
The attack was condemned 
by Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi on Twitter, 
saying “we categorically reject 
any attempt to obstruct the 
democratic process.” “We 
support the completion of 
the constitutional deadlines 
to end the political crisis,” he 
said. In an earlier incident 
that occurred late last month, 
rockets hit the Green Zone as 
the lawmakers were about to 
vote for the deputy speaker of 
parliament. Sadr’s supporters stormed the parliament 
on June 30 and stalled the 
government formation process when Al-Sudani was 
first named the nominee. 
Al-Sadr’s bloc won 73 seats in 
Iraq’s October 2021 election, 
making it the largest faction 
in the 329-seat parliament.

The US Congressional committee probing the attack on 
Capitol Hill has summoned 
former US President Donald Trump to testify on last 
year’s January 6 violence. 
“BREAKING: The Select 
Committee unanimously 
votes to subpoena Donald 
J. Trump, former President 
of the United States, to provide evidence as part of the 
committee’s investigation,” 
the January 6th Committee 
tweeted on Thursday after 
its ninth hearing. 
The Hill reported that at 
the latest hearing, the committee released new details 
about the former US presi- 
dent’s plans to claim victory 
in the US election. They also 
probed his refusal to accept 
defeat in the face of evidence. 
“Trump’s claims were not 
supported by sufficient evidence of fraud or irregulari- 
ties. In fact, they were baseless, as judges repeatedly 
recognized.
“In none of these 62 cases 
was Trump able to establish 
any viable claims of fraud 
sufficient to overturn the 
election results,” the Committee said in another tweet. 
Representative Liz Cheney, 
the vice chair of the commit- 
tee, said the panel is obligated 
to seek answers directly from 
the man who set this all in motion
“So, this afternoon, I am of- 
fering this resolution that the 
Committee direct the Chairman to issue a subpoena 
for relevant documents and 
testimony under oath from 
Donald John Trump in connection with the January 6th 
attack on the United States 
Capitol,” Cheney said in her 
remarks, a copy of which was 
posted on her website. 
Earlier, investigators held 
eight public hearings in 
June and July as part of the 
inquiry, which Trump, a 
Republican, has denounced 
as a political “witch hunt” 
launched by Democrats. On
January 6, last year, thousands of individuals mostly 
Trump’s supporters  stormed 
the Capitol in Washington, 
DC, and disrupted a joint 
session of Congress to affirm the 2020 presidential 
election results.
This incident is considered 
one of the worst attacks on 
the U.S. Congress in more 
than 200 years and led to 
Trump’s second impeachment by the House of 
Representatives shortly before 
his term officially ended.

As the Communist Party’s 
National Congress approaches, reports circulate 
that President Xi Jinping 
will be given the title “Chairman,” which was given to 
the founder of the People’s 
Republic of China and then Supreme Leader Mao Ze- 
dong six decades ago. 
This means Xi could lead 
China for life, with consolidated and bigger powers. 
Given Xi’s autocratic governance over the past nine 
years, the development 
brings bad news for minority communities, 
civil society, and the general public, 
who are subjected to invasive surveillance and a lack 
of freedom of speech.
 Indefinite power can 
even bring back political 
violence and the cult of 
personality of the Mao era. The 
reformist leader of China, 
Deng Xiaoping, had in 1982 
brought reforms to put an 
end to authoritarian rule, 
which enforced a limit of 
two terms for the presidency. However, Xi in 2018 
made constitutional changes to allow himself to be the 
president of China for life. 
The upcoming National 
Congress, slated to be held 
on October 16, is going to see 
the 69-year-old Xi formally 
taking over the reins for the 
third time and becoming 
undisputable and unchallengeable. It would also kill 
the concept in Chinese politics called “qi shang ba xia,” 
which means leaders aged 
above 68 must retire. 
The Chinese Communist Party and news media 
are pumping up patriotic 
rhetoric, listing Xi’s “glorious” achievements and 
urging people to fight for 
his “greatest dream” of Chinese nation revitalization. 
Global observers claim Xi 
is trying to reach the height 
in China’s modern politics 
that was so far only enjoyed by Mao. However, 
some suggest he wants to 
surpass Mao.

The Pakistan government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz 
Sharif has washed its hands of its responsibility and blamed 
climate change for the floods in the country, but the reality is 
that it failed in providing a quick response, which could have 
mitigated the catastrophe enormously.
The government gave due credit to global warming and climate 
change, but there was more to it than what met the eye. 
Pakistan could have avoided the worst crisis of the decade, but 
it was preoccupied with political wrangling when the alarm 
bells first rang, according to a Karachi-based journalist in the 
local news outlet
 The Nation. Let’s do a quick rewind. The unprecedented 
rains began in mid-June. A state of emergency was declared 
by the government on August 25. Soon after, lives began to get 
affected by the flash floods, and the political parties in 
Pakistan started to run their PR campaigns. 
Former Prime Minister Imran Khan turned the plight of the 
people into a PR stunt. Khan made hollow claims to raise 
millions. It was all very murky. 
The Nation reported that there is no information available in 
the public domain on the spending of the amounts collected. 
They made money from the donations the political parties 
received from various charities and various NGOs. There 
were a few who were affected more than others. The cities of 
Nowshera and Charsadda, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
province (formerly Northwest Frontier province), and 
their suburbs were the first major communities to be hit by 
the unprecedented floods. 
The flash floods left about 7 million homeless this summer. 
The actual numbers are much higher than the government 
data. Infrastructure was destroyed and families, including 
pregnant women and infants, were swept away. It is the 
worst-ever natural disaster in the country to date.

Maulana Hidayatur Rahman, 
the leader of the 
“Give Rights to Gwadar” 
movement, alleged that the 
China-Pakistan Economic 
Corridor (CPEC) had become a China-Punjab 
corridor and Balochistan, on another side, is only receiving 
disappointment. 
Rahman said that even 
the borders and the seas 
have been forbidden for the 
Baloch people. He further 
added that this is the reason 
that people revolted against 
the state as they were extremely disappointed with 
the federation. Balochistan 
is facing all sorts of problems despite being the 
largest province with the most 
natural resources and the 
people of Balochistan are 
suffering from poverty and 
hunger. People of Balochistan are not getting any 
benefit from CPEC and they 
are living in their own nation 
as strangers.
The Pakistani administration maintains the 
false belief that the Chinese-fuelled 
‘development’ in Balochistan 
will benefit the local population, the sad reality is that 
these protests saw locals 
demanding basic necessities, such as livelihood, clean 
drinking water and basic 
health facilities which they 
continue to be deprived of, 
reported vernacular media. 
Many groups in Pakistan, 
both ethnic and religious, 
continue to suffer due to neglect from political and 
government indifference. The 
leaders acknowledged the 
growing menace of drug addiction amongst the younger 
generation. They criticized 
the government for its failure to adopt any preventive 
strategy against drugs. 
In the past year, the protest 
against CPEC has intensified. Last year in August, 
people burned tires, chanted 
slogans, and shut down Pakistan’s port city of Gwadar, 
protesting against China’s 
illegal fishing in nearby waters and the CPEC project 
which is a part of President 
Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road 
Initiative, stretching across 
70 countries in the world. 
In July, nine Chinese workers were killed when a vehi- 
cle laden with explosives and 
driven by a suicide attacker 
rammed the bus in which 
they were travelling towards 
the Dasu Hydropower project in the Upper Kohistan 
area of Pakistan’s Khyber 
Pakhtunkhwa province.

*
West Asian and North African regions 
need to tread cautiously when lending 
Chinese contracts, as by expanding its 
regional footprints, China is pursuing 
its policy of gradually laying down the 
debt trap and turning these regions into 
its economic colonies.
Many Chinese loans are dubious 
in nature, as many of them also have 
political clauses attached to them. By 
utilising its technical expertise, China 
is becoming a key technology provider 
in several of these countries, reported 
Global Strat View. WANA nations are 
keen to collaborate with China in 
infrastructure, weapons procurement, 
oil exploration, space research, and 
sustainable development. Notably, the 
popularity of Chinese language studies 
also appears to have increased in 
WANA countries. 
There have been multiple developments 
in the recent past that suggest 
enhanced cooperation between China 
and WANA countries. 
On September 19, foreign ministers 
of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) 
countries met with Chinese Foreign 
Minister Wang Yi in New York. The 
meeting occurred on the sidelines of 
the 77th UN General Assembly. 
Bilateral cooperation between Riyadh 
and Beijing appears to be on the 
upswing. Saudi Arabia is set to host the 
first China-Arab Summit in December 
2022. China Power Construction 
Corporation of China, China Power 
International Holdings Company, and 
Shanghai Electric are in line to bid for 
the Amiral Cogeneration Power Project 
in Jubail. 
Meanwhile, the implementation of 
a systematic plan to teach the Chinese 
language to Saudi learners is also under 
discussion. Through the Talal Abu 
Ghazaleh Confucius Institute in Jordan, 
Beijing offers similar courses and workshops 
in Chinese language, culture, and 
traditional Chinese medicine.

Media reports said while 
militancy and violence 
are on the rise along the 
Pakistan-Afghanistan 
border, the federal government in Islamabad is 
busy fighting its political 
battles with ousted former Prime Minister Imran 
Khan, media reports said. 
The Times of Israel, citing 
multiple reports, reported 
that one of the most contentious issues between 
Pakistan and Afghanistan 
is the border between the 
countries where the security prospects continue to 
remain grim and unresolved. 
Things are rather ironic 
with Pakistan-Taliban relations. It is the same Pakistan 
that had expected strategic 
depth with the Taliban after 
its takeover of Afghanistan, 
but the situation remains 
sloppy. 
The impact of militancy 
is adversely impacting 
many civilians as well. 
There have been continuous 
protests calling for peace in 
the region. Slogans of “we 
want peace” were raised at 
the end of September after eight people, including 
a former “Aman” (peace) 
Committee head and two 
policemen, were killed by 
a remote-controlled bomb 
that struck their vehicle in 
the Ghlo Kandaw area of 
Kabal tehsil in Swat valley 
The agitators comprised a 
large number of youths, elderly, lawyers, transporters, 
traders, doctors, and students who held placards 
inscribed with slogans against 
the terrorists and seeking 
peace. The border conflict 
between two nations over 
the Durand Line that divides 
not just the two countries 
but also the Pashtuns remains a bone of contention 
between the two nations.

Have you ever observed that your 
thoughts, emotions, 
behaviour and notions of 
anything and everything are 
derived from other people’s 
thoughts?
We live in a society that is 
conditioned by the media, 
our educational system, our 
communities, our neighbours, places of worship, 
and our families. From our 
earliest memories, we are 
taught what is right and 
what is wrong. We are informed of what to wear and 
what not to. We have been 
told by a variety of practitioners what our ideal weight 
and height should be. Our 
parents may have even been 
given a growth chart to 
track our weight and height 
throughout our development. As a society, we have 
become very conditioned to 
think that our bodies must fit 
into a specific set of parameters. It is strangely funny 
that we have a need not only 
to track our body mass index but that every person 
must fall within a certain 
guideline. The world is so 
obsessed with body image 
and our media, social media, advertisements, etc., are 
24x7 drilling it into us. And 
this is where body shaming 
begins because anyone who 
does not fit the prescribed 
parameters is called out, 
at times, dog whistled and 
isolated. It is a phenomenon 
that affects all genders, including women and men 
across age groups.
Body shaming is not gender, weight, height, or bodyspecific. At its core, body 
shaming is the intentional 
act of humiliating another. 
It occurs through mocking, critical comments, and 
shaming related to one’s 
body type. It is the intent to 
cause them to conform to 
a specific standard. Body 
shaming causes an individual to feel shame or disgust 
in relation to his or her own 
body. It perpetuates a false 
impression of the right body 
type and fuels self-doubt and 
issues related to self-esteem. 
Everyone has felt the emotional effects of body 
shaming at one point or another: 
embarrassment, fear, shyness, anger, rage, anxiety, 
envy, and anytime there is an 
emotional reaction to something, the body will respond 
physically. Body-shaming is one of 
those emotions that comes 
up when you believe that 
there is something wrong 
with you. Shame is deep-seated. It is literally a strike 
against the soul.
Shame is believing that 
who you are is not enough, 
broken, damaged, not good, 
wrong, sinful.
The thing about body 
shaming is that it comes 
from thinking a belief that 
is untrue. It is either by a 
standard set by society, your 
family, or yourself through 
observation and interpretation.
Body shaming contributes 
to a variety of psychological, 
physiological, and mental 
health disorders such as 
stress, anxiety, eating disorders, 
panic attacks, body image issues, loneliness, social 
anxiety, depression, digestive issues, and even suicidal 
ideation. It is a silent killer. 
The truth is that there is 
no right way. It is important 
to have self-dignity and be 
healthy. But you need not 
conform to a way of thinking just because most people 
think or feel that way. 
You are allowed to be you. 
You are allowed to set your 
own beliefs, your own rules, 
and most importantly, your 
own boundaries. Who you 
are at your core was created 
by something bigger than 
life itself, and not one other 
person who was created is 
the same.
Who you are is ok. Learn- 
ing to love and accept your- 
self can take time, but it can 
also save your life.

The recent 50-second 
commercial by AU 
Small Finance Bank 
featuring Bollywood actors 
Aamir Khan and Kiara Advani has led to an uproar on 
social media. This isn’t just ridiculous but also reflects the 
stunted growth of our understanding of development, as 
more women are becoming 
educated and economically 
independent. Many women, 
in a hypothetical situation, 
may be the breadwinners 
of the family. Therefore, the 
advantage and the message 
of this advertisement must 
be lauded. But instead, what 
we witness is the backlash, 
where, naturally, Aamir 
Khan is blamed for hurting 
religious sentiments. 
Madhya Pradesh Home 
Minister Narottam Mishra 
has advised Aamir Khan to 
avoid ads and practises that 
offend religious sensibilities. 
But why are we not addressing the message? That is the 
question one must ask the 
authorities that are expressing distaste for the advertisement. 
Cut to the ad, which depicts 
Aamir Khan and Kiara Advani as newlyweds 
returning from their wedding and 
discussing how none of them 
cried during the bidaai. The 
commercial also depicts the 
pair arriving at the bride’s 
home and the husband taking the first step inside the 
house, which is not a traditional Hindu practise for 
brides.
The questions that arise 
need to be addressed. There 
are many situations where 
the girl is a single child and 
has ailing parents. Does 
this mean that it is imperative that she abandon her 
parents to embrace the new 
home, or should she remain 
unmarried?
This advertisement could 
have had a very strong 
message given out towards 
gender equality. This advertisement could have been a 
game changer with a popu- 
lar actor like Aamir Khan, 
who would’ve encouraged 
men and women as equal 
partners in marriage, breaking free from the shackles of 
old norms and traditions that 
don’t make great sense in this 
changing world.
This is also an eye opener 
for the aversion to self-examination of people over gender 
topics. These moral keepers 
don’t take into account the 
plausibility of other situations in a person’s life. The 
change must be in tweaking 
traditions that are also done 
on a regular basis when no 
one is looking. People cut 
short traditions and it is acceptable in situations beyond 
their control. Then why this 
outrage?
Priests of the famous Mahakaleshwar temple in 
Madhya Pradesh had objected to 
the advertisement, claiming 
that it offended Hindu sentiments. One can’t overlook 
the flesh trade that has a 
social sanction in Madhya 
Pranesh’s Neemuch, Ratlam, 
and Mandsaur. The mem- 
bers of the Banchhada community consider the birth of 
a girl auspicious as it means 
another breadwinner for the 
family. Girls are groomed to 
become prostitutes by their 
parents when they are between 11 to 14 years of age. In 
2015, the Madhya Pradesh 
Women Empowerment 
Department conducted a 
survey in 38 villages in Mandsaur. The data revealed that 
the population in the district was 3,435, with 2,243 
women and 1,192 men. The 
rise in the number of women 
in the community is not only 
because of their birth but also 
because of the rampant purchase of trafficked girl children. These are little girls, 
sometimes sold at a measly 
sum of Rs 100 sometimes. 
She is also expected to serve 
as many as her body can 
handle for the day. When 
will the morality and the inhuman neglect be addressed 
towards this community in 
Madhya Pradesh?
If you look at Aamir Khan’s 
acting trajectory, he has often challenged ethical and 
religious norms. One must 
accept that he is expressing 
the sentiments of millions of 
people across the country.
As expected, the ad saw a 
major backlash. A popular 
tweet said, “Aamir Khan 
loves to do ads, 
which mock Hindu traditions. He 
will never dare talk or 
do any ads pertaining 
to Hijah Burqua.
Triple Talaq Halala. He maintains
pindrop silence on SatTan Se Juda.
Evidently, the most vulnerable sentiment of religion is 
used methodically to create 
more damage to an already 
fragile system we are currently living with. Narottam 
Mishra has stated that the 
advertisement hurts people’s sentiments. Trafficking 
women is also a long-lived 
tradition in Madhya Pradesh. 
As citizens of India, we hope 
that the government will 
discourage such a culture, 
instead of raising its voice 
against an advertisement 
that empowers women to be 
the caretakers of their families forever.
Talking to Rekha Bhattacharjee, a recently 
widowed elderly lady who lives 
with her daughter, lauded 
the advertisement, saying, 
“I wish I had the ability to do 
this for my mother. When 
she was ailing, I had to leave 
my parents in New Delhi and 
move to another town to start 
my married life. I felt guilty 
and tormented at times, but 
I had no choice.”
One can’t overlook the 
Khasis from Meghalaya, 
which account for the state’s 
largest ethnic community. 
They are one of the last existing matrilineal societies 
in the world. Here, children 
receive their mother’s last 
name, husbands move into 
their wife’s home, and the 
youngest daughter inherits 
the ancestral property. They 
are not Hindus, but this tradition helps many women 
be able to be there for their 
elderly parents’ needs. Our 
culture has always evolved, 
and it is time now that women in films and in society are 
allowed to choose to move 
to their new home or bring 
their husband into their maternal home. We laud Deepika Padukone for talking 
openly about mental illness. 
We need another popular 
actor to continue to come out 
and speak up where voices 
remain unheard. Maybe if 
Akshay Khanna had done 
this advertisement, all would 
have been well.

This week on We Women Want, we have two 
women of style and substance Shabana Azmi 
and Divya Dutta. The two 
have acted in the recently 
released Sheer Qorma, a 
movie about acceptance 
and belonging and one 
that explores non-binary 
relationships. The movie 
was given an award at 
the Yellow Stone Film 
Festival recently held 
in the National Capital. 
Both Shabana and Divya 
are known for their distinctive, 
often unconventional female character 
roles. Speaking to NewsX’s 
Senior Executive Editor 
Priya Sahgal, the duo spoke 
about how gender issues 
and women’s roles are 
treated on screen.
Shabana and Divya said 
that they would never do 
a role that would demean 
women. If they do a role 
of a woman who has been 
wronged or who is mis- 
guided, they would like to 
see some progression of the 
character and some positive messaging at the end of 
it. Neither would go in for 
meaningless stereotypes.
They also talked about the recent hijab controversy, where 
women in Iran are burning 
their hijabs while in India 
some are fighting for the right 
to wear them. As Shabana 
said it is a matter of choice at 
the end of the day and quoted 
a couplet she had written 
during Covid, “Do din mein 
mask pehen kar thak gaya 
wo admi, jo kehta tha aurat 
ko parde mein rehna hai “  .
The show also talked about 
art, for as Shabana said, art 
is not meant to soothe, it’s 
not a lullaby but a means to 
raise our voice, dissent, and 
Divya Dutta spoke against 
the objectification of 
women and also the rise 
of OTT platforms that allow unconventional film 
makers space to explore 
themes that may not make 
it to mainstream cinema. 
Catch fresh episodes of ‘We 
Women Want’ every Saturday at 7:30 PM on NewsX. 
The program will also be 
streamed live on major 
OTT platforms: Dailyhunt, 
Zee5, MX Player, ShemarooMe, Watcho, Mzaalo, Jio 
TV, Tata Play and PayTm 
livestreams.

Many people go 
through their lives 
carrying the burden of guilt or regret over 
past mistakes. For some, the 
weight is such that it crushes 
their sense of self-worth and 
they are unable to live a normal life, and go to their grave 
haunted by the wrongs they 
have done.
Most of us know, even if 
we do not remember it all 
the time, that every action 
has an equal and opposite 
reaction, and that we reap 
what we sow. This universal 
law warns us of the consequences of bad karma, but 
it also encourages us to do 
good karma. If we have done 
something wrong, repentance cannot undo it, but we 
can learn from it and direct 
our energy to doing good.
Positive and charitable 
actions lift our spirits and 
bring benefit to others. They 
keep the mind engaged in a 
healthy way, help us forge 
good relations, and, when 
done repeatedly, create a 
habit of doing good. Soon, a 
time comes when the good 
deeds outweigh past mistakes, and we not only feel 
happy, but can also offer support to others. This is how 
character transformation is 
realised.
There are several examples in history of people 
leaving behind an ignoble 
past and achieving greatness. St. Augustine is 
perhaps the most famous. A 
hedonist who fathered an 
illegitimate son, he eventually heeded the pleas of his 
devout mother and became 
a Catholic priest. Today, he 
is regarded as a saint.
Similarly, Angulimala, a 
serial killer, became a monk 
after an encounter with the 
B.k. geetA
no one is beyond redemption, and each one of us has 
the potential for spiritual 
progress regardless of our 
background. As someone 
said, ‘The only difference 
Buddha, and Valmiki gave 
up life as a robber and meditated for years in penance 
before he went on to compose 
the epic Ramayana. 
These examples show that 
between the saint and the 
sinner is that every saint has 
a past, and every sinner has 
a future.’
This is one reason criminal justice systems in some 
service, fully or partially, in 
lieu of other forms of punishment, such as imprisonment 
or paying a fine.
Even where such a provision does not exist, convicts 
countries make use of the 
principle of doing something 
charitable to make amends 
for a mistake, whereby those 
convicted of a crime are required to do community 
turn of mind
get reduced punishment if 
they show true remorse or 
cooperate with the law enforcement agencies, and sen- 
tences are commuted if the 
convict has a record of good 
behaviour. Such measures 
aim to encourage reform, so 
that convicts emerge better 
persons from their experience of crime and punishment.
While one cannot change 
one’s past, its negative influence on the present and the 
future can be eliminated by 
changing our way of thinking and behaviour. The key 
is to let bygones be bygones 
and turn over a new leaf. A 
mistake does leave a stain 
on the record of our life, but 
repeatedly thinking about it 
is akin to making that stain 
darker. Instead, by taking 
to doing good we can create 
bright spots that will eventually shine such that no one 
notices the stains.

“In order to communicate 
clearly, the primary step is silence, that is, the ability to listen.” - Anthony Strano
Life is relationships, defined 
by the quality of our communication. In communicating 
authentically, and effectively, 
we do not just send the other 
a message, but we build, nurture, empower and nourish 
the relationship itself. How 
do I develop my “authenticity”, so that I am better able 
to communicate? How do I 
acquire the skills to enable 
positive, authentic communication? Authenticity starts 
from our inner world, where 
we set aside time and space to 
develop our innate qualities. 
We can begin with the following three areas:
the right Attitude
Attitude is at the core of what 
we say and do. It is reflected 
back to us in our relationships. Our attitude can rub 
off on others. Attitude is 
born from our perceptions, 
thoughts and feelings, influenced by our memories, past 
experiences and beliefs. As 
an example of how thoughts 
create attitude, consider how 
the day will unfold if we 
wake up in the morning with 
the thought, of having to go 
to work. 
This creates an attitude of 
resentment or reluctance, so 
what would relationships with 
others be like during the day? 
However, when we wake up 
with the thought of wanting to 
go to work, because we feel fortunate to have a job, or we like 
the work, then we will relate to 
others with enthusiasm. Our 
exchanges with others will be 
more positive, more energising 
and more productive.
Self-reSpect
Self-respect depends on knowing who I am – delving into my 
inner world, knowing that I 
am a pure, imperishable soul, 
full of all virtues, a being of 
light energy able to connect to 
the Supreme Soul. Knowing 
this as my real identity means 
that I will not align my identity 
superficially to the external 
aspects of gender, age, occupation, social status and the like. 
To do so sets me up to identify 
myself based on the opinion of 
others. Grounded in spiritual 
awareness, I develop my specialities and inner qualities. I 
value myself and self-esteem 
is the result. I value others 
and their uniqueness. From 
this position, I am also confident, loving, trustworthy, 
honest, open and able to generate 
positivity in thoughts, attitude 
and actions.
the Art of liStening
“We never listen when we are 
eager to speak.” - Francois de 
la Rochefoucauld
A powerful listener is able 
to be fully present and, in the 
moment, so that she/he under- 
stands the point of view of the 
other person, while focusing 
on the subtle tone, facial expressions, body language and 
context of the communication 
partner.
Listening at the deepest level 
requires a link of empathy: an 
attentive calm and openness 
that focuses the mind so that 
reality is grasped, and you understand what is being said. 
The authentic communicator 
recognises her/his intention to 
build relationships that reflect 
the virtues of, at least, an honest and open heart.
“I will speak sweetly. I will 
speak with love. I will speak 
less, and I will speak with honesty.” - Dadi Janki

The great dichotomy in following a spiritual practice 
is that, even though talking 
about the ideas and knowledge that we are taught, is 
very beneficial for ourselves 
and to others, it can only be 
truly authentic if we have, in 
fact, absorbed and practised 
it for the self. Otherwise, it is 
an intellectual exercise only, 
and only touches the intellects of others, not the hearts 
and minds.
Overcoming the reluc- 
tance to share something 
that we have not yet mastered, makes us vulner- 
able, because we are aware 
of the dissonance between 
the aim and the current reality. So how do we share 
what we know to be true, 
and have the aim to achieve, 
while being aware that we 
are not there yet? First and 
foremost, we have to have 
honesty. Honesty with the 
self is a major step. To live an 
honest life means that there 
is always a part of me that is 
observing the self. It is not 
honesty to just ‘own up’ to 
mistakes I have made; real 
honesty lies in being able to 
share what I have learned 
from the mistake and what I 
have resolved to transform, 
in such a way that it becomes 
useful for someone else.
This requires the second 
attribute of humility. This 
requires being prepared to 
acknowledge that I am on a 
journey, and not allow the 
ego to create a false façade by 
creating, or trying to protect, 
an image that I am not able 
to maintain. Our intentions 
and attitude are picked up by 
others long before we speak. 
We need to be mindful of not 
projecting what we want to 
be rather than what we are 
just now. The third aspect 
is honour. I need to give regard and respect to myself 
and honour the process. 
This means I will be able 
to respect, honour and give 
regard to others, on their 
journeys. 
I only know if I am walking my talk when I am relat- 
ing with others. When I am 
working in a team, for example, with all the opportunities for 
clashes of personality, ideas, intentions and 
aims. Can I retain the spiritual qualities of love, peace, 
tolerance and patience? 
So, walking the talk is being true to the self, honour- 
ing and respecting that self, 
and interacting with each 
one, with humility. This is 
only possible when we understand that we are incredibly subtle, spiritual beings 
with great reservoirs of love 
and peace, joy and wisdom 
within. As we move along, 
checking and changing, 
we understand the need to 
charge and renew ourselves 
each day. This allows us to 
clearly see the quality of our 
relationships with others 
and most importantly with 
the Divine – a source that 
never changes, is constantly 
giving, always benevolent, 
always honest and always 
true. 
In this way, I begin to see 
the same qualities emerging in the self, of beauty, 
compassion, generosity, and 
truth. If I am too self-centred, then I cannot walk the 
talk. Dadi Janki used to ask: 
“How much of the time do I 
spend watching myself and 
how much time do I spend 
thinking about how others 
perceive me?” She spent 95 
per cent of her time with her 
own self in the sense of how 
she was responding to oth- 
ers in a supportive way, and 
uplifting them.
There is a bigger picture in 
all of this – that of what the 
world needs now. Do I believe that I am the only cog 
making the huge machinery 
of the world drama keep 
turning, holding it all together? If everything becomes 
about me, then my actions 
can never be benevolent. I 
am an important cog, but 
not the only one, yet every-thing I think and say and do 
is making a contribution to 
the world. Journeys are filled 
with delays and obstacles; 
sometimes we win, some times we lose, sometimes we 
fail and sometimes we succeed. Let me not be in denial 
when I am talking about my 
journey, because it is walking along the path that truly 
teaches me humility and 
allows me to learn so much 
and then grow and evolve. 
Sometimes, in the genuine 
desire to get to the end of the 
path, we try to pretend we 
are already there – but we 
need to cover the ground, 
step by beautiful step.

Indian teenager Rudrankksh 
Balasaheb Patil, created history in the Egyptian capital 
Cairo, pulling off a dramatic 
17-15 victory over Italy’s Danilo Dennis Sollazzo in the gold 
medal match and has been 
crowned World Champion 
in the Men’s 10m Air Rifle, an 
Olympic event.
The 18-year-old also emulated 
Abhinav Bindra, India’s first 
individual Olympic gold medallist, as a world champion in 
Men’s Air Rifle. Bindra had 
won the crown in the same 
event in Zagreb in 2006. A 
National Rifle Association of 
India (NRAI) release said the 
Thane boy shot astoundingly 
well throughout competition 
day two of the International 
Shooting Sport Federation 
(ISSF) World Championship 
Rifle/Pistol at the Egypt International Olympic City (EIOC) 
shooting range, to not only 
win the biggest prize of his life 
till date but also a Paris 2024 
Olympics quota for his country. It was India’s second Paris 
quota in the sport of Shooting 
after Bhowneesh Mendiratta 
had won the first in the Men’s 
Trap at the Shotgun World 
Championships in Osijek, 
Croatia, which preceded the 
Cairo World Championships 
for Rifle and Pistol.
Silver medallist at the Junior 
World Championships in 
Lima last year and a gold medallist at the Junior World Cup 
in Suhl earlier this year, this 
was Rudrankksh’s first medal at the senior level. He had 
broken through to the senior
squad in the beginning of the 
year and had registered seventh and 11th-place finishes 
in the Baku and Cairo World 
Cups earlier. Rudrankksh was 
detailed in the second qualification relay on the day and 
when he took his start, teammate Kiran Ankush Jadhav of 
the Indian Navy had already 
logged an impressive 630.6 in 
the first relay to lie third. 
With the top eight making it 
to the next ranking round, Rudrankksh sizzled with a 633.9 
to top the high-quality field of 
114 shooters.
Among those whom he left 
behind on the day were legends like Yang Haoran (dou- 
ble Olympic gold and double 
world champion) of China, 
reigning Olympic champion William Shanner of the 
USA, Chinese teenager and 
Tokyo Olympics silver medallist Lihao Sheng of China 
and Olympic medallists SerhiyKulhish of Ukraine and 
Alexis Raynaud of France. 
Also left behind was team- 
mate Arjun Babuta, who shot 
625.3 to finish in 22nd place. 
n the 25-shot ranking round 
broken down into five series of 
five shots each, Rudrankksh 
had a steady start moving up 
to fourth place after 10 shots 
with a score of 104.2. Compatriot Kiran Jadhav, who had 
also made it to the top eight 
with a sixth-place finish overall in qualification, bowed out 
at this stage in eighth place 
along with Raynaud, who 
finished seventh.
He shot into the lead after 
the third series of shots logging 157 to be 0.1 ahead of Ital- 
ian Sollazzo and 0.7 ahead of 
Yang Haoran as the fifth and 
sixth-place shooters bowed 
out, assuring India of a Paris 
quota place. Patil continued 
to shine and a 10.8 for his 19th 
and a 10.3 for the 10th meant 
that he kept the lead after the 
fourth series as well. It was 
now 0.3 over the Italian and 
a full point ahead of Lihao 
Sheng who had caught up on 
countryman Haoran.
The Italian however had a 
strong final series and wrested the lead from the Indian at 
the end of it, but Rudrankksh 
still made it to the gold round, 
finishing 0.1 ahead of Lihao, 
who settled for bronze. Rudrankksh finished with 261.9 
to Sollazzo’s 262.7.
The gold medal match then 
turned out to be a dogfight. 
The two shooters shoot a single shot each and the winner 
is awarded two points while 
an equal score means they 
split a point each. The first to 
16 points wins. Rudrankksh 
and Danilo split points thrice 
in the shoot-out including in 
the first two rounds.

The countdown to the blockbuster clash of ICC Men’s T20 
World Cup 2022 has begun 
with India set to take on Pakistan in their first match of the 
tournament on October 23. 
With ‘Mission Melbourne’ 
in sight, the team led by Rohit 
Sharma will look to start the 
tournament with a win over 
their arch-rivals. Speaking 
exclusively on Star Sports 
show ‘Game Plan’, former 
T20 world cup winners Gautam Gambhir and Irfan Pathan  
dished out their analysis about 
India’s game against Pakistan 
and how the side can approach  
the match at the Melbourne 
Cricket Ground. Gautam 
Gambhir spoke on how the 
Indian batsmen would have
to try and keep Pakistani pace 
bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi 
at bay and what the batsmen’s 
approach should be when taking on the speedster. “When 
it comes to Shaheen Afridi, 
don’t look to survive. Look to 
score runs from him. Because 
the moment you look to survive, everything becomes really small. Whether it’s your 
backlift, whether it’s your 
footwork, and obviously, in 
T20 cricket you can’t look to 
survive. I know that he can be 
dangerous with the new ball, 
but again, irrespective, the Indian batters need to score more  
runs, get into better positions, 
and look to time the balls rather  
than to hit it. India will be fine 
because India has got the quality in their top 3 or 4 who can 
definitely take on Shaheen 
Shah Afridi.”
Irfan Pathan said,”Look, one 
thing is clear. When you play at  
the MCG, the straight boundaries are not that big. It’s the 
side boundaries that are massive. Obviously, India needs to 
be smart, especially the batting.  
Probably, it will be difficult to 
hit the side boundaries, so 
they have to play the gaps and 
probably convert the twos into 
threes and ones into twos, because running between the 
wickets will very important.” 
Irfan further spoke about 
how the Indian bowlers would  
face the likes of Babar Azam 
and Mohammad Rizwan and 
how their bowlers would have 
to adjust their lengths to try 
and curb the opposition. “Don’t  
give them any width whatsoever, especially Rizwan, because 
he’s the guy who takes the 
Powerplay on his shoulders. 
Just try to get the pace going. 
Babar takes his time. So, you 
need to be aware of those situations and those batters. First 
of all, the line has to be on the 
stumps, with tight lines. And 
with both batters, the length 
changes slightly, “ said former 
India pacer Irfan Pathan.
“When it comes to Rizwan, 
you can afford to bowl more 
fuller. You can try to hit him 
beneath the knee roll. This is 
where your line and length 
can be. And when it comes to 
Babar Aazam, you need to get 
him out leg before wicket, but 
your aim should not be on his 
front leg, it should be behind 
his leg because he’s slightly 
open. See, you need to make 
that kind of planning. This 
is where Arshdeep and Bhuvaneshwar Kumar come in 
with that in-swinging delivery. We need to be aware that 
Pakistan are not very good 
with spin bowling. So, you 
need to keep an eye whether 
you can give one odd over to 
spinners in the Powerplay. I’ll 
be very tempted to see what the  
team management is doing,” 
he added.

Indian women’s cricket team will 
look to record its seventh Asia 
Cup title, while Sri Lanka will eye 
its maiden cup on Saturday when 
the two teams lock horns at the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium in 
Bangladesh.
India have made it to the eighth final 
of the Asia Cup with six titles to their 
name until now. Bangladesh have 
won it once with no other team winning it ever. India have dominated the 
Asia Cup since its inception in 2004. 
Sri Lanka stole a one-run victory over 
Pakistan on Thursday to fix the title 
clash with India.
The Indian team defeated Thailand 
by a huge margin of 74 runs where 
Shafali Verma starred with the bat to 
take India to a 148-run total.
Sri Lanka have a tall task ahead, 
with the team playing its first Asia 
Cup Final. The team played six matches in the league stage of the Asia Cup, 
winning four of them. India and Pakistan handed defeats to the Sri Lankan 
team during their league stages. 
India topped the table of the Asia 
Cup League stages as it lost just one 
game during its entire league journey. 
The team came second to Pakistan in 
its fourth league game.
India will look at Jemimah Rodrigues 
(Asia Cup’s leading run-scorer with 215 runs) and Shafali 
Verma in their batting department 
as the batters have been in excellent 
form in the tournament and have 
scored more than 200 runs each. The
team will also rely on Deepti Sharma’s 
all-around skills to help India seal a 
seventh Asia Cup. Deepti has picked 
up 13 wickets in the tournament while 
also making useful contributions with 
the bat.
Sri Lanka will look at Harshith Samarawickrama to score important 
runs for the team while the bowling 
department’s onus will lie on Inoka 
Ranaweera who was the Player of 
the Match in the semi-finals against 
Pakistan.
India are clearly the favourite if the 
head-to-head records of the last five 
matches are any indication. Sri Lanka 
have lost four of the last five matches 
against India, winning only one.

As the dust settled down 
over the 36th National 
Games and the multiple 
venues in six cities fell silent, it was abundantly clear 
that, with a Herculean effort, 
Team Gujarat helped the 
National Games regain the 
pride of place in the country’s sporting firmament. 
Many experienced athletes 
had given up hope that they 
could compete in a multi-discipline event at home and the 
younger ones were unaware 
of the joys of taking part in 
the National Games. Gujarat 
gave them the experience to 
remember and cherish. Any 
fears that the National Games 
was becoming less relevant 
to the athletes were quickly 
consigned to the sidelines 
with the participation of 
many top guns across 35 
disciplines ranging from 
Aquatics and Athletics to 
Mallakhambh and Yogasana, 
from Badminton and Boxing 
to Wrestling and Weightlifting.

teams, with Services topping 
the charts for the fourth time 
in a row.
Services won the Raja 
Bhalindra Singh Trophy 
with 61 gold, 35 silver and 32 
bronze for a total of 129 medals from 19 disciplines. The 
magnitude of their achievement can be felt when one 
considers that all medals but 
one came from male athletes. 
With Services opening the 
doors to women athletes, this 
scenario can change sooner 
than later.
The battle between Maharashtra and Haryana for the 
Best State Trophy was very 
engaging, too. Maharashtra’s 39 gold, 38 silver and 
63 bronze for a total of 140 
medals came from a broad 
sweep of 28 disciplines while 
Haryana fell back on 23 disciplines to garner 38 gold, 38 
silver and 40 bronze for their 
total of 116.
Viewed purely for the domination of one sport, Hary- 
ana’s 12 gold in Wrestling 
and Services’ 11 in Athletics 
faded before the 19 gold that 
Karnataka claimed in Aquatics. Besides such battles at the 
top, it was heart-warming to 
watch a team like Jammu and 
Kashmir make their presence 
felt with six medals from 
Wushu towards the end of 
the Games.

reached finals and gave a tough ride 
to her opponent Aakarshi Kashyap 
in the second set and secured a silver 
for herself. 
We spoke to Malvika Bansod, the

win a Bronze for the team event and 
a silver in the individual event at the 
36th National Games.
Q. Malvika you gave a good fight to 
Aakarshi Kashyap in the second and the 
deciding set. What sparked you that you 
showed a drastic comeback in the second 
set?
A. I had a great run till finals but 
as I had represented my team in the
team event as well in both QF and 
SF ties, I was tired in the finals and 
couldn’t give my 100 percent. But I’m 
still proud of my performance.
Yes, I got into the flow of the game

A. Preparations for the Asian 
Games and Paris Olympics are going 
on well, I have cracked into the top 
50 of the world, being no. 41 at the 
moment, just behind Saina Nehwal 
and P.V. Sindhu. I hope to continue 
my rise the same way forward.
Q. How was the experience playing 
at National Games as your fellow sports 
personas had really some good things to 
say about the event?
A. This was my first National 
Games and I had a wonderful experience there in Surat. 
The 36th National Games were so well organized, so 
well planned. The entire staff was so 
well equipped, punctual and helpful. 
The stadiums and players lounges 
were always well stocked with necessary supplies required for players. 
I had a wonderful time in Gujarat 
and absolutely loved the vibe and the 
enthusiasm of the entire team there 
along with that of the young student 
audience!!
Q. How do you find Gujarat and Gujaratis?
A. Gujarat is absolutely a wonderful state, so well planned 
and Gujaratis are so hospitable.

With less than 100 days to 
go for the FIH Odisha Men’s 
Hockey World Cup Bhubaneswar-Rourkela 2023, 
the anticipation to witness 
the world’s best hockey players at one of the world’s most 
preferred hockey destinations 
- Odisha, is only increasing by 
each passing day.
Former captain and coach 
Vasudevan Baskaran said 
that the upcoming FIH Men’s 
Hockey World Cup will be a 
great chance for the Indian 
team to perform well and 
finish their campaign on the 
podium. The Silver-medal 
winner from the 1973 World 
Cup believes India can finish on the podium in Odisha 
this January, urges Manpreet 
& Co. to cross the first hurdle 
against Spain to build momentum “I think many of them 
were surprised to see us do 
two warm-ups. The weather 
in Amstelveen was very cold 
and we really wanted to avoid 
injuries, so Jagmohan our fitness trainer would make us 
do two sessions of warm-up,” 
Hockey India quoted Baskaran as saying.
Although India lost the Final 
2-4 in penalties to hosts Netherlands after a 2-2 draw in the 
regulation time, it was this 
match against Pakistan that 
would be recounted as one of 
the best.
“I remember Tanvir Dhar, 
the great Pakistani defender 
asking me in our team hotel have you come to do running 
or play hockey. It was a case of 
being so near, yet so far. We 
saw the Cup slipping from our 
hands, but surely, the Semi Final against Pakistan would be 
one of the best clashes in the 
history of the game. India has 
a great chance to finish on the 
podium in Odisha,” He said. 
With rich experience at the 
Olympic Games and a Bronze 
medal in the inaugural edition 
of the World Cup in Barcelona 
Spain, India was upbeat to 
bring home the Cup. India’s 
campaign got off to a smooth 
start, with 0-0 draw against 
West Germany, 4-0 win 
against Kenya, 1-1 draw against 
New Zealand and 2-0 win 
against Spain. It was, however, 
the Semi Final match against 
Pakistan that Baskaran felt 
was the most memorable from 
the tournament.
“The emotions were so high. 
The Indo-Pak war of 1971 was 
fresh in everyone’s mind. Harcharan Singh and Harmik 
Singh were from Pathankot 
and they had seen the effects of 
that war quite closely, so naturally, we had that urge to win 
against them. The tempo was 
high and interestingly enough, 
the Netherlands crowd turned 
up in big numbers to support 
us,” recalled Baskaran, Captain of the Indian Team that 
won the gold at the Moscow 
Olympic Games in 1980. 
“It was a battle of equals; we 
had the best forward line and 
they had incredible defenders. 
Surjit Singh played his heart 
out in that game because there 
were some tense moments 
against Pakistan. But it was 
that goal by PB Govinda in 
the 62nd minute that put us 
in the Final. A beautiful pass 
from Ajit Pal Singh to Govinda 
who flicked the ball to the left 
of the corner, a goal like that on 
a thick grass pitch was simply 
magical.”
Expressing his confidence 
in the Indian team, Baskaran 
said, “I believe they can definitely finish on the podium in 
Odisha this time. They should 
move on from the CWG Final 
loss to Australia and ride on 
the confidence they gained 
from the Tokyo Olympic 
Games. The team is in the good 
hands of Graham Reid and the 
support staff. I believe they 
have a sure shot at a medal.”
