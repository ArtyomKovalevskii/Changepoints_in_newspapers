
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu 
on Wednesday held 
a telephonic conversation 
with his Indian counterpart 
Rajnath Singh and conveyed 
his concerns about the provocations by Ukraine on the 
possible use of a ‘dirty bomb’. 
“On October 26, Russian Defence Minister 
Sergei Shoigu, Rajnath Singh 
discussed the situation in 
Ukraine. Sergei Shoigu conveyed his concerns about 
possible provocations by 
Ukraine with the use of a 
‘dirty bomb’,” tweeted Russian Embassy in India. 
Responding to Shoigu’s 
telephonic talks, Rajnath 
Singh tweeted, “He briefed 
me on the evolving situation in Ukraine, including 
his concerns about possible 
provocations through use of 
‘dirty bomb’. I reiterated India’s position on the need to 
pursue the path of dialogue 
and diplomacy for an early 
resolution of the conflict.” 
Singh also pointed out that 
the nuclear option should 
not be resorted to by any side 
as the prospect of the usage 
of nuclear or radiological 
weapons goes against the 
basic tenets of humanity. 
In the telephonic conversation, both leaders discussed 
bilateral defence cooperation 
as well as the deteriorating 
situation in Ukraine. 
A “dirty bomb” is a conventional bomb laced with 
radioactive, biological or 
chemical materials disseminated in an explosion. 
Meanwhile, in a briefing on 
radiation security threats by 
the chief of nuclear, biological and chemical protection 
troops Lieutenant General 
Igor Kirillov, the Russian 
Ministry of Defence said that 
it has information about the 
Kyiv regime’s planning to 
commit a provocation by exploding the so-called ‘dirty 
bomb’ or low-power nuclear 
warhead. 
“The provocation is aimed 
at accusing Russia of using 
mass destruction weapon at 
the Ukrainian theatre of operations that would launch a 
powerful anti-Russian campaign in order to undermine 
the confidence in Moscow,” 
added a press release of 
Kirillov.
The Ministry of Defence 
has arranged to counter 
Ukraine’s possible provocations: the means and forces 
are alerted to operate amid 
radioactive contamination
In another development, 
Russian President Vladimir 
Putin on Wednesday surveyed drills carried out by 
his nuclear-capable forces. 
The drills are the latest in 
a series of escalatory comments from Moscow and Pu- 
tin--who observed the drills 
from a control room that 
the eight-month conflict in 
Ukraine could turn nuclear. 
Russian state run media 
ran footage of a submarine 
crew preparing the launch 
of a Sineva ballistic missile 
from the Barents Sea in the 
Arctic. The drills also included launching test missiles
from the Kamchatka peninsula in the Russian Far 
East.
Meanwhile, the US and 
other Western officials have dismissed 
Moscow’s claim that Ukraine is planning to use a so-called 
dirty bomb as a 
Russian false-flag operation. 
The term is often used interchangeably with radiological dispersal device 
(RDD), a bomb where radioactive materials are used. In a joint statement, 
the US, France and Britain three of 
the other nuclear powers on the United 
Nations Security Council said Sunday 
that Russia’s claims were “transparently false”. 
They and Kyiv suspect that Russia 
might use a dirty bomb in a “false flag” 
attack, possibly to justify Moscow’s use 
of conventional nuclear weapons as it 
finds itself on the back foot in eastern 
and southern Ukraine. 
Russia on Tuesday also flagged allegations to the UN 
Security Council that 
Ukraine is preparing to use a “dirty 
bomb” on its own territory.

External Affairs Minister 
(EAM) S Jaishankar met 
the outgoing Chinese envoy

The ongoing tussle between 
Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and the state 
government intensified further on Wednesday with the 
governor writing to Chief 
Minister Pinarayi Vijayan 
stating that Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal ‘’ceased 
to enjoy pleasure’’. 
nior leaders and MPs were 
present at the occasion. 
Kharge, who was elected 
the first Congress chief outside the Nehru-Gandhi fam- 
ily in 24 years, has his task 
areas is essential,” Jaishankar tweeted after meeting 
ambassador Sun. “The normalization of India-China 
relations is in the interest of 
both countries, of Asia and 
the world at large,” he said in 
another tweet. 
Sun, who assumed office in 
July 2019, is leaving at a time 
when the two sides are trying 
to manage ties, following the 
2020 border clash that has 
remained the dominant issue 
between the neighbours. 
In his farewell remarks on 
Tuesday, the Chinese envoy
stressed the 
need to resolve differences between 
India and China 
and uphold the principle 
of non-interference in each 
other’s internal affairs. 
Sun said it is only natural 
for important neighbours 
China and India to have some 
differences but the key is how 
to handle the differences. 
“We should be aware that the 
common interests of the two 
countries are greater than differences,” the Chinese envoy 
said in the remarks posted on 
the Chinese embassy website. 
“...the two sides should strive 
to manage and resolve differences, and look for a proper 
solution through dialogue 
and consultation, instead 
of defining China-India relations by differences. The 
two countries need to respect 
each other’s political systems 
and development paths, and 
uphold the principle of non 
interference in each other’s 
internal affairs,” he said. 
The Chinese envoy said 
that both India-China should 
break out of the “geopolitics 
trap” and find a new path that 
is different from the past. 
“There is enough room in 
the world for China and India to develop together, and 
two countries and peoples 
should have enough wisdom 
to find a way to live in peace 
and achieve win-win cooperation between the two big 
neighbouring and emerging 
countries,” Sun said

Veteran leader Mallikarjun 
Kharge on Wednesday officially took charge as the 
president of Congress and 
pledged to fight against the 
politics of ‘lies and deceit’. 
Former party president 
Sonia Gandhi, MP Rahul 
Gandhi and party’s General 
Secretary Priyanka Gandhi 
Vadra along with other senior leaders and MPs were 
present at the occasion. 
Kharge, who was elected 
the first Congress chief outside the Nehru-Gandhi 
family in 24 years, has his task
cut out as the party faces 
several electoral and organisational challenges. Thanking 
the party workers, Kharge 
said he will work to protect 
the country from “politics of 
lies and deceit”. 
“It is a difficult time and 
efforts are being made to 
change the democracy established by Congress. Now 
our country is seeing politics 
of lies and deceit. Congress 
will break the circle of lies 
and hatred prevailing in the 
country,” he added. 
Targeting the BJP government at the Centre, the new 
Congress President said, “To 
make a new India, they want 
Congress-free India as they 
know that as long as Congress is there, they can’t do 
it. We will not let it happen 
and will continue to fight 
against it.” 
Kharge, while addressing the party leaders, said, 
“Emotional moment for me, 
want to thank Congress 
people for making a worker’s son, an ordinary worker, 
the president of Congress. It 
is a matter of pride to carry 
forward the legacy of the 
Congress.”
The 80-year-old Congress 
veteran said that it was a 
matter of privilege and pride 
for him to handle the responsibility as a party which was 
led by leaders like Mahatma 
Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru 
and Subhash Chandra Bose. 
“As president, it will be my 
utmost duty to look after 
our workers. Together, we 
will build an India that will 
be enlightened, empowered 
and equal for every citizen. 
We will uphold the Constitution of this country, respect 
everyone’s rights and give 
equal opportunities, defeat 
those who spread hate, and 
fight inflation, unemployment and hunger,” the party 
president added. 
“It was on January 15, 1998, 
in Bengaluru when Sonia ji 
at her first public rally said 
she was taking her first political lessons from 
Karnataka. Her politics has been 
that of sacrifice and above 
self-interest and quest for 
power. Sonia ji always walks 
on the path of truth. In this 
era of politicians doing politics only for power, she has 
set an example of sacrifice, it 
is difficult to find any other 
person like her,” Kharge said. 
Speaking about the upcoming elections in 
Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat, 
Kharge said that people 
want change in these states. 
“We will have to show our 
party’s strength in these 
elections. If we all work hard 
and with dedication, we will 
achieve success. We are the 
soldiers of Mahatma Gandhi. 
We are not scared of anyone. 
When a Congress worker 
will get rid of his fear, then 
even the biggest of kingdoms 
will be defeated.”
The new Congress Chief 
said that the contribution 
of the Congress party in the 
making of modern India is 
unmatched. 
Later during the day, 
Kharge chaired a meeting of 
the party’s Central Election 
Committee (CEC) to finalise 
candidates for the Gujarat 
assembly polls. Former 
Congress president Sonia 
Gandhi was also present at 
the meeting. 
Meanwhile, all the members of the Congress 
Working Committee (CWC), 
General Secretaries of All India 
Congress Committee and 
Incharges have tendered 
their resignations, paving 
the way for Kharge to build 
his own team.

*
On the day Mallikarjun 
Kharge took charge as Congress President on 
Wednesday, Rajasthan Chief Minister 
and Congress leader Ashok 
Gehlot said that efforts continued till the last minute to 
make Rahul Gandhi as the 
president of the grand old 
party since he is the only 
one who can challenge Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi and 
BJP government. 
Speaking to media persons 
here in the national capital, 
Gehlot said, “The leadership 
that Sonia Gandhi ji led for 22 
years will always be remembered. We all had requested 
her in 1998 to take over as the 
party president otherwise 
the party will be shattered. 
She took the challenge in the 
interest of the Congress party 
despite having language issues. After that, she was 
Congress President for 22 years 
and the governments were 
formed in 13 states at that 
time. She performed 
very well as a party chief that 
which no one can forget.” He 
further said that it was Rahul 
Gandhi’s desire that for once a non-Gandhi 
should become the President of the party. 
“It was Rahul Gandhi’s desire that for 
once a non-Gandhi should become the 
President of the party. However, till the 
last minute, efforts were made to make 
Rahul Gandhi the party president as only he 
can challenge Modi and the government,” 
said Gehlot. The Rajasthan chief minister 
also congratulated Mallikarjun Kharge 
and promised to will work to strengthen 
the party.  “Today is a new beginning. We 
congratulate Mallikarjun Kharge Ji and 
will work to strengthen the party,” Gehlot 
said.

complain about it on Green 
Delhi App.

The Election Commission of 
India (ECI) on Wednesday 
directed Gujarat Chief Secretary to transfer 51 officials 
to their respective headquarters (HQs) and report about 
the compliance by 4 pm on 
Thursday, sources said. The 
list of 51 officials includes six 
senior IPS officers. 
The ECI had earlier sought 
an explanation from the 
state Chief Secretary and 
Director General of Police 
(DGP) for failing to file a 
compliance report on the 
transfer of officials. Sources 
told news agency that the 
poll authority received a 
compliance report from 
Gujarat Chief Secretary today and more than 900 
officers of various grades and 
services were transferred
as per ECI guidelines and 
instructions.
But ECI has observed 
that 51 officers are yet to be 
moved. 
Sources said ECI has given 
directions that these remaining officers, including six 
senior IPS officers, should 
be asked to report to respective headquarters and com- 
pliance be sent by 4 pm on 
Thursday. 
Sources also said that the

received compliance reports, 
regarding the transfer and 
posting of officials directly 
connected with the conduct 
of Assembly elections that

The ongoing tussle between 
Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and the state 
government intensified further on Wednesday with the 
governor writing to Chief 
Minister Pinarayi Vijayan 
stating that Finance Minister K.N. Balagopal ‘’ceased 
to enjoy pleasure’
In his letter to the Chief 
Minister, the Governor 
asked Vijayan to consider 
the matter with the seriousness it deserves and take 
action which is constitutionally appropriate. 
The Governor’s letter was 
a result of the Finance Minister’s comment that “those 
from Uttar Pradesh would 
not be able to understand
the ways 
of educational 
institutions in 
Kerala”. The 
minister had said that in response to Khan’s “needless” 
interventions in the affairs 
of the Kerala universities. 
The minister’s mention 
of Uttar Pradesh had irked 
rect dig at him as he hailed 
from the north Indian state. 
His displeasure at the remark was stated in a 
missive to the chief minister on 
25 October. 
Citing media reports of 
Balagopal’s speech at a University campus here on 19 
Khan. He saw it as an indian  
“ceased to enjoy my pleasure”. 
October, “which seeks to 
the fire of regionalism and 
provincialism and if allowed 
to go unchecked they may 
have an erosive and baneful 
influence on our national 
unity and integrity” and the 
Governor was left with no 
option but to convey that 
the Finance Minister has 
“Reported statements of 
Kerala FM K.N. Balagopal 
are a violation of the oath I 
had administered to him. A 
minister who deliberately 
violates the oath and undermines the unity and 
integrity of India can’t continue 
to enjoy my pleasure,” said 
Kerala Governor.
“In these circumstances, 
I’m left with no option but 
to convey that K.N. Balagopal has ceased to enjoy my 
pleasure. I hope that you 
consider the matter with the 
seriousness it deserves and 
take action which is constitutionally appropriate,” he 
said in a letter to CM.
The Governor said that the 
remarks of Finance Minister 
K.N. Balagopal seek to create a wedge between Kerala 
and other States of the India 
an Union and project a false 
impression as if the different 
States of India have different 
systems of higher education. 
Khan said that although 
others like Education Minister and Law Minister have 
indulged in attacks on him, 
but he wishes to ignore 
them as they hurt him personally. “But if I do not take 
cognizance of the seditious 
remarks of K.N. Balagopal, 
it would be a grave omission of duty on my part. The 
comments of the Finance 
Minister challenge not only 
the national unity and integrity but also the 
Constitutional Convention that 
makes it necessary that the 
Governor of each state shall 
be from outside the State,” 
said Khan.

In a first high level visit from 
the UK to India since Prime 
Minister Rishi Sunak took 
charge on Tuesday, Britain’s 
Foreign Secretary James 
Cleverly will travel to India 
to attend the meeting of UN 
Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) to be held in 
Mumbai and Delhi on 28-29
October. He will pay homage 
to the victims of 26/11 terror 
attacks in Mumbai. 
Sources told  The Daily 
Guardian that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar 
will use the occasion to have 
a separate bilateral meet- 
ing with the British Foreign 
Secretary during which 
discussions aimed at deepening India-UK ties under
the leadership of PM 
Rishi Sunak will 
be held. In fact, 
EAM may have 
brief bilateral chit-chat with 
his counterparts from other 
countries also, but he would 
like to have much wider 
discussions with his British 
counterpart.
Jaishankar and Cleverly 
had a telephonic conversation before the latter was 
confirmed to continue in the 
post of Foreign Secretary by 
the newly appointed British 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 
on Tuesday. The two ministers then discussed several 
issues including counter 
terror joint efforts. All eyes 
are on the state of negotiation of the India-UK Free 
Trade Agreement (FTA) that 
missed the Diwali deadline, 
sources said. However, Jaishankar and James Cleverly 
discussed counter-terrorism 
and Ukraine conflict prominently during the telephonic 
conversation. Shortly after 
the telephonic talk, Cleverly 
was reappointed foreign secretary by PM Sunak. 
Sources say that during 
bilateral talks the two ministers will be having more 
elaborate discussions on the 
issues such as terror, Indo-Pacific, Ukraine, Taiwan, etc.   
Meanwhile, India is ready 
to set the narrative during 
the upcoming CTC meeting 
in Mumbai and Delhi that 
the global community must 
shun double standards on 
the issue of terrorism. At 
the press briefing ahead 
of the meeting, the United 
Nations Counter Terrorism 
Committee Chair Ruchira 
Kamboj called for united 
voice on terrorism. She 
also emphatically said that 
there should be no double 
standards on the issue in 
what set the agenda that 
New Delhi is going to pitch 
for. “A terrorist is a terrorist, 
no matter which country he 
operates against,” say diplomats. MEA Secretary West 
Sanjay Verma said that because of FATF, Pakistan had 
to admit and begin some sort 
of legal process against two 
individuals directly responsible for 26/11 terror attacks. 
However, diplomats who 
are privy to strategic meetings for this event told TDG 
the daily guardian review 
thursday | 27 october 2022 
new delhi
that the global community’s 
attention would be sought 
towards Pakistan’s based 
terror outfits. India is set to 
stress on the need to keep a 
close watch over these outfits 
in the neighbouring country. 
Moreover, concerns over 
terrorism emanating from 
Afghanistan will also be 
highlighted by India. “Special efforts on the part of 
Indian side will be seen to 
draw global attention towards the threat of 
terrorism in the region particularly Afghanistan based terror 
activities and Taliban turning a blind eye to the same,” 
say sources.
Ruchira Kamboj, India›s 
Permanent Representative 
to the UN, Counter-Terrorism Committee Chair, said 
that over the past two decades, member states have 
made tangible progress in 
countering terrorism and violent extremism conducive 
to terrorism. Yet, terrorist 
threat persists and despite 
our best efforts has evolved. 
The United Nation Security Council’s two-day 
meeting in India on counter-terrorism will focus 
on dealing with use of internet, new 
payment mechanism and 
drones by terrorists. 
Ministry of external affairs 
secretary Sanjay Verma said 
the overarching theme of the 
meeting would be ‹countering the use of new and 
emerging technologies for 
terrorist purposes›. “It›ll begin with tribute to victims of 
terrorism,” he added. 
Mindful of addressing this 
issue while also recognising 
potential of technologies 
to increase effectiveness of 
counterterrorism efforts, 
the Committee has come 
together in India to hold its 
special meeting on countering use of new and 
emerging technologies for 
terrorist purposes, Kamboj said. 
The meeting will be hosted 
in Mumbai and Delhi on 28 
and 29 October, respectively. 
Verma said he larger purpose of this unprecedented 
meeting of the Counter-Terrorism Committee in 
Mumbai will resonate with rest 
of the world because what 
happened in 2008 was an 
attack on what would be the 
identity of India in financial 
and commercial space.

In yet another example of 
‘competitive Hindutva’, Delhi 
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has appealed to Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi to 
consider including the images of Goddess Lakshmi and 
Lord Ganesh on currency 
notes in India to “improve 
the economic situation of 
the country”. 
In his letter to the Chief 
Minister, the Governor 
asked Vijayan to consider 
the matter with the seriousness it deserves and take 
action which is constitutionally appropriate. 
The Governor’s letter was 
a result of the Finance Minister’s comment that “those

will get blessings if on currency notes, there is a photo 
of Ganesh Ji and Lakshmi ji on one side 
and Gandhi ji on other side,” Kejriwal 
said in his address. 
“If Indonesia can do it; choose Ganesh 
Ji, so can we... I will write to the centre 
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow to 
appeal for it... we need the almighty’s 
blessings apart from the efforts to settle 
the economic condition of the country,” 
Kejriwal said. 
Lord Ganesha is inscribed on the 
20,000 rupiah note of Indonesia. 
Political observers have stated that 
this is a desperate bid to grab a pie from 
BJP’s traditional vote bank. It’s a competitive 
politics on Hindutva. Kejriwal 
was trying to address an audience who
are staunch Hindu and traditionally 
BJP supporters. 
For obvious reasons, this has created 
huge political war of words. BJP MP 
Manoj Tiwari lashed out at Kejriwal. 
Speaking at a press conference, Tiwari 
alleged that AAP leaders have abused 
Hindu Gods and Goddesses in the past. 
“Their (AAP) party leaders, the party’s 
Gujarat state unit president and AAP 
ministers have abused Hindu Gods and 
Goddesses and have said many things 
but they are still in their party. Now, 
what will they do in upcoming polls? So 
for their face-saving, they are coming 
up with new conspiracies. Those who 
objected to Ram Mandir have come 
with a new mask,” Tiwari said. 
“On one side they abuse Hindu Gods 
and on the other hand they are coming 
in poll time saying such things,” he said

Delhi Lieutenant Gov- 
ernor VK Saxena 
on Wednesday approved Chhath Puja at designated ghats on the 
Yamuna and asked chief minister 
Arvind Kejriwal to ensure 
clean ghats and water for 
devotees.
The LG also cautioned Arvind Kejriwal against 
“misleading and presumptuous 
publicity.” The Lieutenant 
Governor’s directives came 
in a reply to Kejriwal’s tweet 
in which he said that Puja 
could be held anywhere on 
the Yamuna.
The LG said the Chief 
Minister’s statement was 
creating confusion among 
people. “The proposal to 
hold Chhath Puja approved 
by the LG was specific to 
designated Ghats—Kejriwal 
tweeted as if Puja could be 
held anywhere on the Yamuna, creating confusion 
amongst people,” the LG’s 
secretariat office said.
LG Saxena also directed 
the Revenue and Environment departments to 
strictly enforce the National 
Green Tribunal’s orders on 
pollution in the Yamuna. 
On October 21 Delhi Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot 
told ANI that “Keeping in 
view the religious and spiritual beliefs and sentiments 
of lakhs of people from UP 
and Bihar living in Delhi, 
CM Kejriwal has approved 
my proposal to allow the 
celebration of Chatth Puja 
at different ghats along the 
Yamuna River.”
“Delhi government has 
always facilitated the occasion by providing various 
facilities in the form of construction of ghats, 
ensuring cleanliness around the 
places where offerings are to 
be made by the devotees, etc. 
This year too, the administration is all geared up to 
provide the facilities to the devotees at around 1,100 Ghats,” 
the minister had said.

suspect that the animals 
may have been poisoned. 
However, the cause of death 
will be revealed after the

Locals are angry over the 
harsh treatment of the dumb 
creatures. The locals are 
inquiring as to who killed 
them and where such a large 
quantity of monkeys came 
from.
“We had never seen such 
an incident in the district. 
Somebody brought the 
monkeys on a tractor and 
left them near the Silagam 
Village forest area,” Krishan 
added.
The Forest Officer further 
said that the case has been 
filed under the Animal Act 
and further investigation is

The Prayagraj Development 
Authority has issued a notice 
to the Global Hospital to vacate the building by October 
28. The hospital came into 
the limelight after it allegedly 
transfused fruit juice instead 
of blood platelets to a dengue 
patient.
The civic authorities have 
termed the building “illegally 
constructed.” The hospital is 
likely to be bulldozed. Deputy 
Chief Minister Brajesh Pathak 
has assured strict action 
against the hospital if they are 
found guilty. He said that the 
platelet packet had been sent 
for testing.
“Taking cognizance of the 
viral video of Jhalwa-based

27 Sept 22, enrollment of cadets in the trg years is being

“This is a serious issue. 
Cadets aspire to appear for 
BJP VS AIMIM
found guilty, strict action will 
be taken against the hospital,” 
Pathak tweeted in Hindi. 
Earlier, the hospital was 
sealed after a preliminary 
inquiry revealed that “some 
irregularities” were found, 
according to Additional Chief 
Medical Officer, Dr AK Tiwari. 
“The (CMO) chief medical 
officer ordered a probe after 
the patient died. In the probe, 
some irregularities were 
found. The hospital has been 
sealed till the probe is completed,” the additional CMO 
said on Thursday.
A probe has been initiated, 
and action will be taken after 
the completion of the investigation. The complainant has 
filed an FIR, the official said.
However, according to the 
owner of the hospital, Saurabh 
Mishra, the platelets were 
brought by the attendants of 
the patient.
“The attendants were given 
the slip to bring platelets. They 
brought five units of platelets 
in the evening. When three
units were used, there was 
a reaction in the patient. We 
stopped the transfusion. The 
platelets that were brought by 
the attendants to the patient 
were transfused to the patient. 
It belonged to the SRN Blood 
Bank. The hospital has no responsibility for it,” he said. 
The hospital owner alleged 
that the patient’s attendants 
were responsible for bringing 
the platelets.
“We do not test the platelets 
that the attendants bring. How 
is the hospital responsible if 
the attendants fetch the wrong 
platelets? It should be the responsibility of the attendants 
to ascertain whether they are 
authentic,” the hospital owner 
said.
“We had referred the patient 
to a higher center after the attendants requested to do so 
following the deterioration in 
the health of the patient. The 
patient had not died here, the 
death happened two days later 
in another hospital,” Mishra 
added.

The BJP on Wednesday 
took a jibe at AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi’s 
remark that he wishes to 
see a hijab-clad girl as the 
Prime Minister of India. 
At a press conference here 
on Tuesday, the All India 
Majlis-e-Ittehadul Musli- 
meen (AIMIM) President 
Owaisi said, BJP wants to 
eradicate secularism and 
equal opportunity for all in 
the country. Following this, 
he said, he wants to see a 
girl in a hijab as the Prime 
Minister of the country. The 
Hyderabad MP’s remarks 
were made after reporters asked him about Rishi 
Sunak’s becoming the first 
Indian-origin prime minister of the United Kingdom. 
The BJP’s Shehzad Poonawalla tweeted: “Owaisi ji 
hopes that a hijab-wearing 
girl becomes PM of India! 
Well, the Constitution bars 
nobody, but do tell us when 
will a hijab-wearing girl 
get to become President of 
AIMIM? Let us start with
that?.”
In his press conference, 
Owaisi said that one of the 
two judges on the Supreme 
Court bench gave his judgement in favour of the hijab. 
Later, he stated that the 
judge stated that it is necessary for Muslim girls to 
study, and that wearing 
hijab and going to school is 
not a problem.”It is a very 
positive judgment,” the 
AIMIM chief said. 
Following a split decision 
by a two-judge SC bench, 
the hijab matter is with the 
Chief Justice of India (CJI) 
for the constitution of an 
appropriate bench.
“BJP thinks they are in 
danger from halal meat, 
Muslims’ caps, and their 
beards. They have problems 
with their eating habits. The party is actually 
against Muslim identity,” 
the AIMIM chief said. 
“PM’s words ‘Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka 
vishwas’ are empty rhetoric. 
BJP’s real agenda is to end 
India’s diversity and Muslim identity,” AIMIM Chief 
Owaisi added.

The Rajasthan government 
has announced plans to connect 500 madrasas in the state 
with a digital mode of education by building smart 
class-rooms, according to an official 
notification on Wednesday. 
The government has also approved an amount of Rs 13.10

In West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) was 
charged for “ruining the 
institutions and wrecking 
the careers of the young,” 
according to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on 
Wednesday. The National 
Cadet Corps (NCC) in West 
Bengal is experiencing difficulties as a result of Mamata 
Banerjee’s administration 
‘refusing to transfer cash,’ 
according to Amit Malviya, 
who oversees the saffron 
party’s information and 
technology department. 
A letter from Major General 
US Sengupta, Additional 
Directorate General (ADG) 
of West Bengal and Sikkim, 
NCC, to the Ministry of Defence was included in the 
tweet. The two-page letter 
from the Directorate of West 
Bengal and Sikkim stated 
that the budget allocation 
has remained the same despite arduous efforts and 
correspondence at various 
levels, including liaison with
the state’s finance secretary 
and personal presentation 
of the issue to the defence 
secretary by the Directorate

“This is a serious issue.

scores as it helps them in

with more than 55 per cent 
marks do not need to sit

Days after Diwali, Delhi was 
wrapped in a blanket of smog 
as the air quality remained in 
the "very poor" category as 
the overall air quality index 
(AQI) stood at 323 and people were forced to once again 
use face masks. Meanwhile, 
the Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP) blamed stubble burning as the cause of pollution. 
According to the System 
of Air Quality and Weather 
Forecasting and Research 
(SAFAR), the AQI in the 
overall Delhi region on 
Tuesday was in the "very 
poor" category at 323. However, in Lodhi Road, the AQI 
was in the 'poor' category at 
273. Despite the complete 
ban on firecrackers, people 
in a huge number burst 
crackers to celebrate Diwali in Delhi, and the very 
next day the pollution level 
plunges from the "poor" to 
the "very poor" category. 
In a statement, Delhi State 
President Adesh Gupta said 
that for the last 15 days, incidents of stubble burning 
have been coming to the fore 
in Punjab.
"On the last day, more than 
1000 stubble was run there, 
and the Punjab government 
took no action during this
time. Arvind Kejriwal used 
to blame the incidents of 
stubble in Punjab for the last 
two years, but now Arvind 
Kejriwal's government is 
in Punjab, including Delhi, 
so why is he not taking any 
steps now," Adesh Gupta 
said. The BJP slammed the Aam 
Adami Party (AAP) for banning the firecrackers ahead 
of the festival and said that 
the party is anti-Hindu.
"Delhi's air quality index 
is above 300, due to stubble 
burning. The Delhi government is just a government 
of advertisements. We have 
also filed an RTI, in which 
we have come to know that 
the smog towers are not 
working and their maintenance cost is Rs 2 crore. 
Although Diwali has been 
celebrated for centuries and 
this time the level of pollution has increased in Delhi 
even after very few firecrackers were released on 
Diwali," Adesh further said. 
Notably, in the Delhi University area and Pusa, the 
AQI remained in the "very 
poor" category at 365 and 
322 respectively.. Further 
near IIT Delhi, the AQI was 
in the 'poor' category at 280. 
At Mathura Road, the AQI 
was in the "very poor" category at 322.

The Supreme Court of India 
has agreed to examine the 
validity of the age restriction 
of 35 years on women's reproductive rights for con- 
ducting pre-conception and 
pre-natal diagnostic tests. 
A bench of Justices Sanjay 
Kishan Kaul and Abhay SOka on October 17 issued 
a notice to the Centre and 
others on the aspects relating to age restriction only. 
"Issue notice restricted to 
the aforesaid aspect," the 
court had said.
The court was hearing a 
plea filed by petitioner-in-person Meera Karuna Patel, 
who is also an advocate. 
Advocate Patel submitted 
that much water has flown 
since the petition was filed 
and amendments have been 
made, but one aspect still 
needs consideration. 
She cited Section 4(3)(i) 
of the Pre-Conception and 
Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex 
Selection) Act, 1994 to argue that the age restriction 
of 35 years is a restriction 
on women's reproduc- 
tive rights and, in light of 
the recent decision of this 
Court titled "X vs. Principal Secretary, Health and 
Family Welfare Department, Govt. of NCT of Delhi 
and Others," the provision 
would not withstand judicial scrutiny.
Section 4 of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal 
Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 
1994 deals with the regulation of pre-natal diagnostic 
techniques.
According to this section, 
no prenatal diagnostic techniques shall be used or 
conducted unless the person 
qualified to do so conditions 
that the age of the pregnant 
woman is above thirty-five 
years. In September, the 
Supreme Court gave a landmark judgment and held 
that all women are entitled 
to a safe and legal abortion. 
The court also stated that 
the definition of rape for 
the Medical Termination of 
Pregnancy Act must include 
marital rape.

station suffered significant 
damage as a result of the 
incident, with its main gate

he picked up an argument 
with an unidentified individual. After the incident, 
he went back to his residence 
in Malaviya Nagar. However, 
he returned to Khan Market

Former Maharashtra Home 
Minister Anil Deshmukh on 
Wednesday moved the Bombay High Court in connection 
with the Rs 100 crore extortion case filed by the Central 
Bureau of Investigation. 
This comes days after a 
special CBI court rejected 
Deshmukh's bail plea on 21 
October. The hearing on the 
NCP leader's bail plea will 
take place on 11 November. 
Earlier, rejecting the 
bail application of Anil 
Deshmukh, the CBI court 
said that in this case, the 
statement of public witness 
Sachin Waze had been recorded by the CBI during 
the hearing of the bail application.
He was accused of instructing police officers to illegally 
collect Rs 100 crores from 
Mumbai bar owners every month.
"It is clear from the statements of the witnesses that 
Anil Deshmukh is the main 
conspirator in this whole 
case. The charges against 
him are very serious. In such 
a situation, if he is granted 
bail, he can influence the case 
and the witnesses," the CBI court said.
"Whatever medical facilities Anil Deshmukh needs 
is being given to him, so he 
cannot be granted bail even 
on medical grounds. CBI's 
investigation is still in the 
preliminary stage, so it is 
not right to grant bail to Anil 
Deshmukh at this stage," the 
court added.
Deshmukh continues to be 
in judicial custody in Arthur 
Road prison as he is also being investigated by the 
Central Bureau of Investigation 
(CBI) in a corruption case. 
Deshmukh was arrested by 
the Enforcement Directorate 
(ED) in November 2021 and 
is currently in judicial custody. According to the ED, 
Deshmukh had misused his 
position as state home minister and collected Rs 4.70 
crore from various bars in 
Mumbai through some police officers.
Earlier on 11 October, the 
Supreme Court refused to 
cancel the bail granted to 
the former home minister in 
the money laundering case 
lodged against him by the 
Enforcement Directorate 
(ED).

A Mumbai court recently sentenced a 25-year-old 
businessman to one and a half years in 
jail after convicting him of 
sexually harassing a minor 
girl and calling her an "item." 
The Mumbai Dindoshi 
sessions court last week 
convicted one Mohammad 
Abrar Khan for outraging the 
modesty of a minor girl. "The 
accused used to tease the victim and called her 'Item'," the 
court said. The accused has 
been sentenced to one and 
a half years in prison and 
fined Rs 500. "The accused 
addressed her by using the 
term "item," which is a term 
generally used by boys to address girls in a derogatory 
fashion as it objectsify them 
in a sexual manner. The same 
would clearly show his intention to offend her modesty. 
Such offences need to be dealt 
with a heavy hand as a lesson 
needs to be meted out to such 
roadside Romeos, in order to 
protect the women from their 
uncalled for behaviour," the 
court order said.
The case pertains back to 
2015, when 25-year-old Mohammad Abrar Khan was 
booked in Mumbai after a girl 
filed a complaint.
The victim alleged that Khan 
and his friends used to harass 
her repeatedly.
According to the court or- 
der, on the day of the crime, 
a 16-year-old girl was on her 
way from school and walking 
through a lane in Millat Nagar, 
the accused, who was sitting 
with his friends in the lane, 
came behind her, pulled her 
hair and said in Hindi, "Hey, 
item, where are you going?" 
As the victim felt ashamed, 
she told the accused not to do 
so. At this, he started abusing 
her and told her to do whatever she could as she could 
not harm him in any way. 
Hence, the victim made a call 
to the number "100" from her 
mobile phone and asked for 
help. The police reached the 
spot within a short period of 
time. However, the accused 
had run away from the spot 
by that time.

Ever since the abrogation of 
Article 370, ample changes 
have taken place in the region. The tourism industry in 
the Union Territory has been 
allocated Rs 786 crore, which 
has witnessed remarkable 
achievements, including a 
significant uptick in profit 
generation over the last few 
months.
This significant boost of 
184 percent (as compared to 
the last year's allocated fund) 
has a lot to do with the betterment of infrastructural 
facilities in the region. 
Despite the noise and attention that the region has 
attracted over the last few decades, basic infrastructural 
support and connectivity 
measures were never priorand social development of 
the region and its people. 
With the construction of 
the new Chenab Bridge, 
which was completed at the 
cost of Rs 1,327 crores under 
the Udhampur-Srinagar Baramulla Rail Link Project, 
a corridor for transit in and 
around the Kashmir Valley 
has also been planned to be 
completed within a limited 
time frame of the next four 
years.
The government of India 
is also making a significant 
push to ensure better infrastructural facilities for the 
region's people and attract 
visitors. This has resulted in 
a fortuitous surge in tourist 
activities with better law and 
order, a promising security 
system, and the maintenance 
of peace, in addition to infrastructural and connectivity 
improvements.
A tourist destination that 
is now being promoted on 
all possible global forums, 
Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh have witnessed their 
highest-ever tourist footfall 
and air traffic in recent years. 
The Kashmir Valley has 
been the destination that has 
attracted most tourists. 
To maximise tourism here, 
direct international flights 
itised. In the last few years, 
rapid strides have been made 
in the arena of infrastructure 
have also been introduced. 
Apart from the leisure activities that form a core part 
of tourism, better security 
and resulting faith in the 
law and order mechanism of 
the region have ensured that 
religious tourism within the 
Union Territory has always 
taken place smoothly and 
with ease.
The sector of tourism witnessed a significant boost 
in April 2022 with the 
highest-ever record of 102 
to and fro flights as well as 
around 15,199 average daily 
passengers.

Manohar Lal-led 
government today completed 
eight years in Haryana.  Addressing a press conference 
in Delhi and presenting a 
report card  he said that in 
these eight years, special focus has been laid on chalking 
out the three ‘C’ s, a strategy 
to uproot Corruption, Caste 
and Crime. Besides this, the 
emphasis has also been given 
on promoting 5S Shiksha, 
Swasthaya, Suraksha, Swabhiman and Swavlambhan for 
ensure holistic development 
of Haryana.
He also released a booklet 
on the government’s achievements compiled by the De- 
partment of Information, 
Public Relations, and Languages. He said that in the last 
eight years, dozens of radical 
changes have been made in 
Haryana, but the introduction of Parivar Pehchan Patra 
is at the top of the eight highlights of his government. 
The Chief Minister said, 
“Through this one of a kind 
umbrella scheme, while 
considering the family as a 
unit, benefits of all the welfare schemes, programmes 
and services being run by 
the State Government are 
being given on a single platform. Today, all the welfare 
schemes are being linked to 
PPP,”

“Through this one of a kind 
umbrella scheme, while 
considering the family as a 
unit, benefits of all the welfare schemes, programmes 
and services being run by 
the State Government are 
being given on a single platform. Today, all the welfare 
schemes are being linked to 
PPP,”
He further added, “Automatic disbursal of pension 
benefits is being ensured 
through PPP. As soon as a 
person attains the pension 
age, the pension automatically starts through PPP. Besides 
this, the work of making yellow ration cards is also being 
done through PPP.  Initially, 
this scheme has been started 
on a pilot basis in the districts 
of Sirsa and Kurukshetra. He 
said that in the first phase of 
Mukhyamantri Antyodaya 
Parivar Utthan Abhiyan, a 
target has been set to identify 
about 2 lakh such poor families having an annual income 
of less than 1 lakh. After identification, the government has 
set a target to increase the 
family income of such families by up to Rs.1 lakh.
The Chief Minister said that 
while focusing on maximum 
governance and minimum 
government, 572 services 
and schemes from 42 departments have been made 
available online on Antyodaya 
Saral Portal. This step has 
not only reduced human in- 
tervention in providing government benefits but also 
ensured that the benefits reach 
the grassroot level.
He said, “As many as 12 lakh 
complaints were received on 
the CM window alone, out 
of which 90 per cent were 
resolved.  Not only this, but 
with the successful implementation of the Teachers 
Transfer Policy, the age-old 
system of “pick and choose” 
was completely eliminated. 
This transparent transfer 
system started by teachers 
has now been implemented 
in other departments as well. 
The online transfer policy has 
been implemented in 214 cadres, with more than 80 posts 
in 43 departments’
He also said that Haryana 
has emerged as the country’s 
sports hub in the last few 
years. Haryana gives maximum cash prizes to 
medalwinning sportspersons.  The 
government has ensured 
the jobs of medal winning 
players. 550 posts have been 
reserved annually for the 
medal winners, which will be 
increased in the coming time.

BJP’s slogan for the upcom- 
ing Assembly elections, 
“Change the Vogue” seems 
to be in trouble due to rebels.  However, the top 
leadership is finding ways to settle 
scores with the rebellions. 
On Tuesday, Yuvraj Singh 
Kapoor decided to withdraw 
his nomination in favour of 
the BJP. Yet there are many 
who are still upset with the 
BJP. On the other hand, the 
Congress leadership is also 
striving hard to make its rebels come in terms with them. 
In the BJP, after seeing 
the situation getting worse, 
party President J.P Nadda 
has himself taken the front. 
Notably, Himachal Pradesh 
is Nadda’s home state and, 
therefore, the prestige of the 
BJP high command is directly at stake in the hilly state. 
This is why Nadda himself 
had to enter the field and 
convince the rebels, as the 
withdrawal of nomination 
takes place on 29 October. 
In the first list of candidates, the party named 
Indira Kapoor from Chamba 
by cutting the ticket of the 
sitting MLA Pawan Nayyar, 
but later changed the candidate to his wife Neelam 
Nayyar. She was declared 
the candidate from Chamba 
within two days after heavy 
opposition from the workers 
at the local level. Senior party leader Maheshwar Singh 
was fielded from the Kullu 
seat, but his son Hiteshwar 
Singh raised the rebel flag 
and announced to contest 
as an independent from the 
Banjara seat.
Nadda tried to persuade 
both the father and son, 
but when he did not agree, 
he cut the father’s ticket as 
well. Now the BJP has declared Narottam Thakur as 
its candidate. J.P Nadda met 
Vandana Guleria, daughter 
of Jal Shakti minister Ravindra Singh, who was angry 
about not getting a ticket.  In 
protest against her brother 
Rajat Thakur, the General 
Secretary of State Mahila 
Morcha did not file a nomination from Dharampur in 
Mandi.
Dissatisfied with ticket 
distribution in Himachal 
Pradesh, more than 15 candidates each from the BJP and 
Congress are contesting as 
independent candidates for 
the assembly elections. This 
has increased the uneasiness 
in the party. The last date for 
filing nominations was 25 
October.
TDG spoke to Co-Incharge 
Elections in Himachal, 
Sanjay Tandon, to find out 
how the BJP is planning to 
settle scores with rebels. He 
exhorted that everyone in 
leadership is assigned a job 
and they are meeting everyone who got upset during the 
procedure.
The following leaders from 
the BJP are now contesting 
as independents: 
Maheshwar Singh (Kullu), 
his son Hiteshwar Singh 
(Banjar), former Rajya Sabha 
MP Kripal Parmar (Fatehpur), former MLA Tejwant 
Negi (Kinnaur), KL Thakur 
(Nalagarh), Abhishek 
Thakur (Sundernagar). 
Praveen Sharma (Mandi 
Sadar), Subhash Sharma 
(Bilaspur Sadar), Vipin Nehria (Dharamsala), Mano- 
har Dhiman (Indore), Indra 
Kapoor (Chamba), Sanjeev 
Sharma (Badsar), Rajinder 
Dhirta (Rohru), and Raj Kumar Kaundal ( Jhanduta).

As many as 376 candidates 
filed their nominations for 
the Himachal Pradesh Assembly polls on the last day 
taking the total to 630. 
Himachal Pradesh will go 
to the polls on 12 November, 
while the counting of the 
votes will be done on 8 December. The state has 68 
assembly seats. A notification 
for the state elections was 
issued on 17 October and 
the last date for the filing of 
nominations was 25 October. 
The Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP) dropped Maheshwar 
Singh after his son Hiteshwar filed his nomination as 
an independent candidate 
from the Banjar seat against 
the party’s official candidate. 
The BJP released the first 
list of 62 candidates on 
Wednesday. The BJP won 
44 seats in the previous assembly polls while Congress 
Rishi Sunak.
won 21 seats. 
In Mandi district 81 candidates filed their papers on 
Tuesday, followed by Kangra 
72, Bilaspur 23, Kullu 19, 
Kinnaur 3, Chamba 34, Sirmour 35, Shimla 30, Una 29, 
Hamirpur 26, Solan 23, and 
Lahaul-Spiti one. 
In Shimla, Gaurav Sharma 
filed his nomination as an Independent candidate, while 
Chaman Rakesh from Aam 
Aadmi Party, Rakesh Kumar 
Gill from BSP, and Tikender 
Singh Panwar filed his nomination as CPI(M) candidate. 
From BJP, a 57-year-old 
graduate Sanjay Sood, a tea seller by profession who has 
been given BJP’s ticket for 
Shimla Urban constituency 
to contest the Himachal 
Pradesh assembly election 
filed his nomination on Friday.  
He has been grabbing all 
the eyeballs in the hills ever 
since he was given a ticket by 
the BJP. Sood has been the 
part of BJP since 1980 and 
has served in Mandal, Zila, 
and also as a counsellor of 
Shimla city. 
“I am thankful to BJP that 
they have shown faith in me 
as a small party worker. As 
you already said, the party 
has replaced the minis- 
ter and I have been given 
the party’s candidate from 
Shimla Urban. As far as you 
are talking about the replacement of Minister Suresh 
Bhardwaj ji, he is our senior 
leader and the party wants 
to win all three seats from 
Shimla organizational district. He is a tall leader and 
will win the seat and that is 
the only reason the party has 
given him to shift to another 
Assembly constituency and 
I am sure we shall win these 
three seats including Shimla 
Seat,” said Sanjay Sood. 
Scrutiny of papers will be 
held on 27 October and the 
last date for the withdrawal 
of papers will be 29 October.

All major parties announce 
schemes to woo women 
voters, but when it comes 
to ticket allotment, female 
candidates are looked down 
upon by their parties. Female 
candidates do not even have 
a fair representation in the 
elections, with only 15 women running from all national 
parties.
Out of the 561 nominations, 
final scrutiny will be conducted on 29 October. The ruling 
BJP has announced the ‘Naari 
Ko Naman’ scheme under 
which a 50 percent waiver 
has been given to women 
travellers on bus fares. AAP 
has promised a Rs 1,000 
monthly allowance to all 
women above 18 years, and 
Congress has gone a step 
ahead and promised Rs 1, 
500 per month.
Going by the previous 
trends in Himachal Pradesh, 
women voters have outnumbered men since 1998. But 
when it comes to the distribution of tickets, they have, so 
far, suffered a bummer. This 
time, the BJP has given tickets to six women, out of which 
five are new faces in the fray. 
The Opposition Congress is 
banking on only three female 
candidates. While the Aam 
Aadmi Party gave six women 
tickets in its first election. 
The BJP leader, Vandana 
Guleria, daughter of seventime MLA and Minister 
Mahender Singh Thakur, who 
lost to her brother in the race 
to get a ticket seat, asked on 
social media: Why is it always 
a woman who has to make a 
sacrifice in a political dynasty. 
Looking at the voting percentage in the year 1998, 
72.21% of women cast their 
votes in Himachal, surpassing that of men (70.26%) for 
the first time. A total of 13.01 
lakh voted against 12.84 lakh 
men. There were 25 female 
candidates in the fray, with 
five from the Congress and 
four from the BJP. Six women were elected to the House, 
which is the highest ever in 
Himachal legislative assembly history.
In 2017, the women’s voting 
percentage was 77.92%, while 
only 70.58% of men voted, a 
difference of 7.34 points. A 
total of 19.15 lakh women 
voted against 18.13 lakh men. 
There were 19 female candidates, with the BJP fielding 
six and the Congress fielding only three.Eleven female 
candidates lost their deposits 
in the elections, while four 
were elected to the Assembly: Asha Kumari from 
Dalhousie, Sarveen Choudhary 
from Shahpur, Reeta Devi 
from Indora, and Kamlesh 
Kumari from Bhoranj.Later, 
Reena Kashyap also entered 
the House after winning the 
Pachhad by-poll on the saffron party’s ticket. 
Sudesh Kumari, member of the self-help group 
“Pihu,’’ said, “Political parties demean and ignore their 
women leaders with the excuse that they are not 
winnable candidates. It is sheer 
gender discrimination. This 
is why women are missing 
from policies and programs. 
For more than a decade, we 
have demanded that political 
parties reserve 33 percent of 
their tickets.”

After Indian-origin Rishi Sunak 
was appointed as UK Prime 
Minister, his relatives in Ludhiana 
expressed happiness and pride 
at the achievement. 
An exhilarated Subhash Berry 
who is Sunak’s mother Usha 
Berry’s first cousin exuded confidence that his nephew Sunak 
would improve the economy of 
the United Kingdom. There is 
an atmosphere of happiness in 
Ludhiana on Sunak becoming 
the Prime Minister of the UK. 
Berry i.e. Sunak’s maternal 
uncle lives on Club Road in Ludhiana. Berry celebrated his 
nephew’s success with other family 
members. He cut the cake with 
Sunak’s mother’s brother-in-law
Rakesh Sood.  Talking to ANI, 
he said, “It is a matter of pride 
for India. I am confident that he 
will improve the economy of the 
United Kingdom.” “There is also 
joy in Ludhiana. The children of 
our family often visit London. It 
is a moment of pride to see him 
as the Head of the country which 
once ruled India,” he added. 
Subhash Berry said his father 
Bhimsen Beri and Sunak’s maternal grandfather Raghubir 
Sen Beri, 92 years old, were real 
brothers. Bhimsen Beri and Ra- 
ghuveer Beri lived in the village of 
Jassowal in Punjab. In 1950, Raghuveer Beri moved to East Af- 
rica and later settled in London. 
The children of the family often 
visit the Sunak family.  Brother-in-law of Rishi Sunak’s mother 
Rakesh Sood said, “the appointment of Rishi Sunak would also 
improve relations between India 
and England. He will soon head 
to England to congratulate the 
family.” 
India and UK were keen to conclude FTA by Diwali and 
negotiations are continuing between 
the two countries. Rishi Sunak 
on Tuesday became UK’s first 
Indian-origin British Prime Minister after being invited by King 
Charles III to form a government. 
Sunak met the king at Buckingham Palace. 
In his first address as the UK 
PM at 10 Downing Street, Rishi 
Sunak said that he will place economic stability and confidence 
at the heart of his government’s 
agenda. “This will mean difficult decisions to come,” Rishi 
 Sunak said.

The police have arrested a 
Chinese woman for staying 
in India under a false identity, the Mandi Police said on 
Tuesday. 
On the basis of information 
that the accused was living 
with forged documents, and 
presently residing in India as 
a Nepali citizen, she was arrested under section 14 of the 
Foreigner Act and 420 and 
467 of the Indian Penal Code 
(IPC), the police official said. 
Mandi Superintendent of 
Police (SP) Shalini Agnihotri 
said that the accused have 
been arrested on Saturday. 
“We have seized cash for 
around Rs 6 lakhs and 40 
thousand and recovered two 
cell phones from her possession. We are trying to use 
interpreters as we were facing 
language issues with her for 
investigation,” she said 
Shalini further said that the 
arrested woman was taking 
religious Buddhist teachings 
at a monastery in Chauntra. 
“We have registered a case in 
Jogindernagar Police Station 
under relevant sections of the 
Foreigners Act and also Section 420 and 467 of IPC. She 
was produced in a local court 
of Jogandar where Courts 
granted a police remand till 
October 27,” said Agnihotri. 
Agnihotri said that more 
details will be known once 
the forensic report is received 
as the police have sent her cell 
phones for forensic examination. “We are 
investigating from every angle as it is 
a very sensitive case. We did 
not find any other angle in the 
case apart from this that she 
was here on fake documents,” 
Mandi SP added.

rival factions of All 
India Anna Dravida 
Munnetra Kazhagam 
(AIADMK) led by Edappadi 
Palaniswami (EPS) and O 
Panneerselvam (OPS) are 
engaged in a heated argument in the court 
demanding the possession of the 
gold armour of freedom 
fighter and Thevar community leader, Pasumbon 
Muthuramalingath Thevar. 
Both factions have already 
locked horns over the leadership issue in the Supreme 
Court. AIADMK treasurer 
and EPS team leader Dindigul Srinivasan filed a petition 
in the Madras High Court 
seeking an order to Bank of 
India, Madurai Annanagar
branch, to hand over the 
gold armour to them. Subsequently, the OPS side filed 
an interim petition, which 
the court accepted, citing the 
pending proceedings in the 
Supreme Court regarding 
the leadership of the party. 
While it is considered a 
matter of honour for OPS 
as he belongs to the Thevar 
community, EPS feels that it 
is important to prove that he 
is a stand-alone leader of the 
AIADMK.
Earlier, the agitating faction had separately 
petitioned the bank officials to 
open the locker and take out 
a 13-kg gold armour to decorate the statue of freedom
fighter and spiritual leader 
Muthuramalingath Thevar. 
His birthday is on 30 October. AIADMK’s tradition is 
to celebrate Thevar Jayanti 
on 30 October every year. 
In 2014, the late former 
Chief Minister Jayalalithaa 
presented a gold shield on 
behalf of the armour party. 
Since then, the AIADMK 
Treasurer was responsible 
for taking the armour from 
the Indian Bank locker in 
Madurai and sending it 
back.
On 11 July, in the General 
Council meeting convened, 
EPS was elected as the interim General Secretary of 
the party. 
Before the meeting, supporters of both rival factions 
clashed outside the party 
headquarters.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister 
M.K. Stalin on Wednesday recommended a National 
Investigation Agency (NIA) probe 
into the 23 October Coimbatore 
LPG cylinder explosion in a car, 
considering the possibility of 
cross-state developments and 
international relations in the 
investigation.
In the recommendation letter, 
Stalin has asked to transfer the 
investigation of the case related 
to the car cylinder explosion in 
the Ukkadam area to the NIA 
and to continue to ensure security in Coimbatore.
Stalin’s order followed a detailed review meeting held 
earlier in the day at the Head 
Office under the leadership of 
the Chief Minister regarding 
the ongoing investigation of the 
case.
At this review meeting, the 
investigation being carried 
out by the police department 
regarding the case and the precautionary 
security arrangements made in the Coimbatore 
district were discussed; and the 
Chief Minister directed the police officers to further ensure 
security in the Coimbatore district 
regarding the current status of 
the case. It was decided to make 
appropriate recommendations 
to the Union Government to 
transfer the investigation of 
this case to the NIA as there is 
a possibility of cross-state developments and international 
relations in the investigation 
of such incidents. The move 
comes after Tamil Nadu Police 
on Tuesday invoked the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) 
Act (UAPA) in connection with 
the case, and a day ago arrested 
five men who were associates 
of Jameesha Mubin, who was 
charred to death in suspicious 
circumstances after an LPG 
cylinder inside a Maruti 800 
he was driving exploded near a 
temple around 4 a.m.
As per police, Mubin, 25, who 
was an engineering graduate, 
has been previously questioned 
by the NIA in 2019 for alleged 
terror links. He has been registered as the primary accused in 
the case. 
The five people arrested on 
Monday night were Mohammad Thalka, 25, Mohammad 
Asarudheen, 25, Muhammad 
Riyaz, 27, Feroz Ismail, 27, and 
Mohammad Navaz Ismail, 27.

A meeting of UN Security 
Council Counter-Terrorism 
Committee will be held in 
Mumbai and Delhi on October 28 and 29 and the 
overarching theme is 'Countering 
the use of new and emerging 
technologies for terrorist purposes'.
Addressing a joint media 
briefing here, Ruchira Kamboj, India's Permanent 
Representative to the United 
Nations who is also Chair of 
the Counter-Terrorism Committee, said that terrorism 
remains one of the most serious 
threats to international peace 
and security and misuse of 
emerging technologies was 
an issue of increasing concern. She said over the past 
two decades, member states 
have made tangible progress 
in countering terrorism and 
violent extremism condu- 
cive to terrorism yet terrorist 
threat persists and "despite 
our best efforts has evolved" 
"Terrorism remains one of the 
most serious threats to international peace and security. 
With the growing prevalence 
of technology and rapid rise 
in digitisation, addressing 
the use of new and emerging 
technologies for terrorist purposes has become an issue of 
increasing concern," she said. 
"Mindful of addressing this 
issue whilst also recognising 
the potential of technologies 
to increase the effectiveness 
of counterterrorism efforts, 
Committee has come together in India to hold its special

The Bharatiya Janata Party 
leader from Telangana and 
former Rajya Sabha MP 
Ananda Bhaskar Rapolu on 
Wednesday resigned from 
the primary membership of 
the party.
In his resignation letter to 
party president JP Nadda, 
the BJP leader alleged that 
he had been ignored and 
humiliated for the last four 
years.
“Social Defence, Social 
Justice, and Social Empowerment are far away from 
the party’s sight. Even to 
have a caste-based census, 
the party and the Union 
Government are against it. I 
have been scared since then. 
Regional pride and language 
emotions are belittled as intentional continued denial 
of justified due to Telangana 
reflects and Single Language 
Hegemony encouraged,” 
Ananda Bhaskar Rapolu 
said in his resignation letter. 
Former Rajya Sabha MP 
Rapolu further said that the 
Union Government has vig- 
orously shown “step-motherly treatment” towards 
Telangana and has grabbed 
away several rightful opportunities from Telangana. 
Since the formation of Telangana, underground water 
levels almost throughout 
the state have raised enormously, and now our state 
is a Womb of River Water, 
leading to sound irrigation 
and climatic safety, he said. 
“Agriculture has become 
safe in Telangana now. I’m 
not asking for praise, but 
your leadership has led the 
state unit to believe that the 
party will never win power 
in the state. Blame the game 
changes. People’s memories 
may be treated as short but, 
shall not forget, they are 
deeply damaged,” he added. 
BJP leader Rapolu further 
alleged in the letter that there 
is a long list of grievances to 
highlight the “disinterested 
nature” of the party, but the 
observation of welfare as 
“FREEBIE”, has shaken me 
to the core, he said.
“For the last four years, I 
was ignored, humiliated, 
underrated, and excluded 
from national roles. With my 
personal way of taking life as 
it comes, I swallowed all the 
agony. No issues. Now, I am 
humbly tendering my resignation,” he added.

Mallikarjun Kharge 
today formally took 
over as Congress 
president. After 24 years, the 
Congress got a non-Gandhi 
president, but from whatever Kharge said before 
taking over, it became clear that 
the real boss of the party will 
remain Rahul Gandhi. With 
Kharge taking over the reins 
of the party, the struggle of 
youth versus elders, which 
has been going on for the 
last eight years, will probably end. Kharge’s first and 
biggest challenge is to unite 
the Congress. Today, during 
Kharge’s assuming office, the 
Congress appeared in its old 
form. The presence of most of 
the leaders of Sonia Gandhi’s 
time made one feel that the 
Congress will come out of internal fights. Happiness and 
contentment were also seen 
on Sonia Gandhi’s face. Rahul Gandhi appeared on the 
stage in a new look sporting 
a beard. Kharge assured both 
leaders that he would follow 
the path shown by them. He 
talked about taking forward 
Rahul Gandhi’s “Daro Nahi” 
slogan. Kharge targeted the 
BJP and Modi government 
completely. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sat in front of the 
stage with office bearers. All 
the state presidents, including 
Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh 
Chief Ministers Ashok Gehlot 
and Bhupesh Baghel respectively, were also involved in 
the ceremony. From Kharge’s 
speech, it was clear that there 
is not going to be much change 
in the policies of the Congress. 
But Kharge did try to avoid the 
politics of appeasement in a 
way by not making a special 
mention in his speech about 
minorities. The Centre was 
accused of spreading fear, 
but by referring to agencies 
like the ED and CBI, Kharge 
has started working from 
today itself in right earnest. 
Kharge conducted a meeting regarding the selection 
of candidates for Gujarat 
elections. Himachal along 
with Gujarat are big challenges in front of Kharge. In 
the middle of these elections, 
some party leaders have given 
a big issue to the BJP by giving 
minority statements on Rishi 
Sunak becoming the Prime 
Minister of Britain, heating up 
the politics of appeasement. 
Today, in his speech, he kept 
a complete distance from the 
politics of appeasement. But 
BJP has started giving weight 
to statements. Mani Shankar Aiyar, Digvijaya Singh, 
P. Chidambaram, Salman 
Khurshid, Shashi Tharoor 
etc. have made statements 
from time to time and put 
the party in trouble.
For the Congress, the 
politics of appeasement has 
become the main cause of 
defeat in the last eight years. 
Congress should avoid the 
politics of Muslim appeasement. The party also 
implemented the suggestions of 
the A.K. Antony committee. After this, the big 
leaders had completely stopped 
speaking on many issues including the Godhra incident. 
Even in the case of the Ram 
temple, the party gave importance to the court’s 
decision, which means the party 
tried to keep its distance from 
the politics of appeasement. 
However, BJP had tried to 
implicate the Congress in 
the politics of appeasement 
due to the communal violence that had taken place in 
a big state like Rajasthan in 
the past. After the Udaipur 
incident, once again the matter had started taking com- 
munal incident in the whole 
country. But Rajasthan Chief 
Minister Ashok Gehlot and 
his government did not allow the incidents of violence 
to take the form of riots by 
strictly suppressing them. 
Congress’ strategy of targeting Prime Minister Narendra 
Modi and appealing to him 
for peace worked. The politics of the minorities did not 
catch much attention. But after Indian-origin Rishi Sunak 
became the Prime Minister 
of UK, a day before Kharge 
taking oath, the Congress 
created a new challenge for 
him by indulging in minority 
politics. PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti’s rhetoric is 
understandable, but the remarks of 
leaders like P. Chidambaram, 
Shashi Tharoor, and Salman 
Khurshid are beyond comprehension. As soon as these 
leaders talked of giving the 
post of Prime Minister like in 
Britain to a minority in India, 
the BJP got a big issue. These 
three are prominent leaders 
of the Congress. Tharoor 
even contested the election 
of the Congress president. 
Manmohan Singh, who came 
from the minority community at the time of Congress, 
was the Prime Minister for 
ten years. Many prominent 
persons, including A.P.J. 
Kalam, became President. 
In such a situation, Salman, 
Tharoor, and Chidnabaram 
have again given the BJP on 
a platter an opportunity to 
indulge in the politics of polarization. The term minority 
will be directly related to the 
Muslim community. 
The politics of appeasement 
has always suited the BJP. 
The leaders have made statements at a time when Kharge 
has just taken control of the 
Congress ship. Kharge is an 
experienced and senior leader. He knows that distance 
should be maintained from 
the politics of appeasement. 
Congress is also keeping its 
distance from such politics 
for the time being. But BJP 
may try to polarise the statements of these leaders by 
making an issue to woo the 
majority of voters in the pollbound states. In the coming 
days, Kharge will also have to 
formulate some form of rulelaw for leaders who make 
such statements.

Rishi Sunak became the Prime Minister of the 
United Kingdom after over 100 Conservative MPs 
backed him for the post, following which, his rival 
Penny Mordaunt, who was hanging in there, 
hoping to push for a vote by the members of the 
Conservative party, failed to get any substantial support 
from the MPs. The vote, if it had gone to the 
Conservative rank and file, would most likely have resulted 
in Sunak’s loss at the hands of Mordaunt a repeat 
of what happened when Sunak had a face-off with 
Liz Truss. In the earlier contest as well, Sunak, who 
was doing extremely well among his urban 
backers, faltered when it came to gaining the support of 
rural white middle-aged Conservative voters, 
giving rise to speculation that the antipathy towards 
him had to with his skin colour. In fact, an audio 
clip that has gone viral on social media, has a Tory 
voter admitting as much on a radio programme, 
that the problem with Sunak is his skin colour. But 
then the lightly coloured Liz Truss, who defeated 
Sunak in the final round, proved to be a disaster 
and sent the UK spiralling down a path of chaos, 
and the rest, as they 
say, is history. At the 
same time, Sunak’s 
elevation shows that 
have come a long 
way to realise that 
petence that matters, 
nak, who saved the 
UK economy from 
imploding during 
Covid, could well be 
the best man to be at

that the problem with Sunak is his skin colour. But 
then the lightly coloured Liz Truss, who defeated 
Sunak in the final round, proved to be a disaster 
and sent the UK spiralling down a path of chaos, 
the helm of affairs at a time when the UK is looking 
at a bleak future. In fact, that a person with roots 
in an erstwhile British colony can reach the highest 
seat of government in the UK, is testament to the 
great shift that has taken place in Britain, which has 
to be lauded. However, at the same time, a section 
of the British media cannot stop complaining about 
the legitimacy of Rishi Sunak’s “non election” one 
reporter on live TV even described it as a coronation
forgetting that in a Parliamentary system of 
democracy, it is the people’s representatives who 
choose the Prime Minister, not the rank and file. 
Some of the others are openly complaining that 
Sunak is too rich to be Prime Minister, again forgetting 
that he himself comes from a humble background 
and his wife’s family’s wealth is hard earned. We 
are talking self-made people here, not colonial 
exploiters who have built their riches and empire on 
the back of starving people.
Amid this, what should matter to us Indians is 
if Sunak will be good for India; whether it will be 
possible to strike a trade deal with the UK during 
his Prime Ministership; if his will be a case of more 
loyal than the king when it comes to India, like the 
way Suella Braverman has been, eulogising the 
British empire as a God’s gift to the colonised. He 
has his task cut out for him, which is to revive 
Britain, and India is certainly not on his priority list, 
unless doing business with India helps that revival 
process, which explains the need for a trade deal. 
In fact the UK needs the deal more than India does. 
Most importantly, it is hoped that he will recognise 
the elephant in the room, the Ukraine war, which 
is pushing western economies into a recession, 
including the UK’s. The world cannot afford to have 
the war escalate or even continue.
As for the debate in India, about when a Muslim 
will become Indian Prime Minister, lest we forget, 
Sunak was elevated to the Prime Minister’s chair 
because of his competence, not because of his skin 
colour or his religious minority status. Sunak’s 
ascension is not a case of affirmative action. India 
being a free and fair democracy will not have any 
problem if a Muslim becomes Prime Minister one 
day in a legitimate manner. In the meanwhile, 
Indians should observe Sunak, but from a distance. 
While New Delhi can always hope that the UK 
under Sunak will go an extra mile to maintain good 
relations with India, it should never forget that 
Sunak is British, not Indian. So the expectations need 
to be tempered.

The Supreme Court in 
the case X vs Arun 
Kumar CK observed 
that an anticipatory bail 
cannot be granted merely 
because custodial interrogation is not required. 
The bench comprising of 
Justice Surya Kant and Justice JB Pardiwala observed 
that the first and foremost 
thing that the court hearing 
an anticipatory bail application should consider is the 
prima facie case being put 
up against the accused. 
In the present case, the 
court was considering an 
appeal filed by mother of 
a victim in a POCSO case 
against the Kerala High 
Court order of granted anticipatory bail to the accused. 
It had been noted by the 
Court that in many anticipatory bail matters, one 
common argument is   being 
canvassed that no custodial 
interrogation is required 
and, moreover, anticipatory 
bail may be granted. 
The bench stated that 
these allegations appear to 
be serious misconception of 
law that if no case for 
custodial interrogation is made 
out by the prosecution, then 
that alone would be a good 
ground for granting of an 
anticipatory bail. However, 
custodial interrogation 
can be one of the relevant 
aspects to be considered 
along with other grounds 
while deciding an application seeking anticipatory 
bail and there may be many 
cases in which the custodial 
interrogation of the accused 
may not be required, but the 
same does not mean that the 
prima facie case against the 
accused should be ignored 
or overlooked and anticipatory bail should be granted 
to him.
Further, it was explained 
by the court that the first 
and foremost thing is that 
the court hearing an anticipatory bail application 
should consider is the prima 
facie case put up against the 
accused. The nature of the 
offence committed should 
be looked into along with 
the severity of the punishment. One of the grounds 
can be the custodial interrogation to decline custodial 
interrogation. Thereafter, 
even if the custodial interrogation is not required or 
necessitated, by itself, cannot be a ground to grant 
anticipatory bail.

The Rajasthan High Court in the case Sant 
Vaidehi Balabh Dev Acharyaji Maharaj v. 
State of Rajasthan and Others observed and 
has dismissed a public interest litigation 
which sought directions from the court to 
restrain candidates from visiting religious 
places during election campaigns.
In the present case, it had been prayed by 
the petitioner for issuance of directions to 
all the political parties and the candidate’s 
contesting elections to not use religion or 
caste for the purposes of election and not to 
visit religious places such as Temples, church, 
Mosques, Ashram, Maths, and other places 
of worship during the election campaign, 
beginning from the period of notification of an 
election.
The respondents to the petition were State of 
Rajasthan, the Election Commission of India, 
and the Chief Election Officer of the Election 
Commission of Rajasthan
The division bench comprising of Chief 
Justice Pankaj Mithal and Justice Sandeep
Mehta observed and has noted that a 
similar writ petition was filed by the petitioner 
in 2018. It was then observed by the Court 
that seeking votes in the name of religion, 
community, caste, or language was already 
statutorily prohibited and, however, no 
general directions in this regard are required. It 
has also been given by the court the liberty to 
the petitioner to approach the Election 
Commission for redressal of his grievances. 
It was observed by the bench of Chief 
Justice Mithal in the order passed on October 
18 observed that the fresh petition filled was 
“nothing but a virtual repetition” of that plea 
which was filled 2018 and that the reliefs 
sought then are the same.
The court stated that it is a settled law that 
successive writ petitions for the same cause 
of action are not maintainable and that filing 
of second writ petition for the same purpose 
is an abuse of the process of law.
Further, it had been directed by the court 
that the Chief Election Commissioner to 
objectively consider and pass appropriate order 
on petitioner’s representation, if any.

The Allahabad High Court in 
the case Mr.X(Minor) v. State Of 
U.P.And Another observed that 
factors such as the nature of the 
crime, the manner of commission, 
the methodology adopted and the 
evidence available assume ample 
significance in deciding to deny bail 
to a juvenile.
The bench comprising of Justice 
Jyotsna Sharma observed and is 
stressed that bail to a juvenile is not 
a must in all cases as it can be denied 
if in the court’s opinion of the accused release would defeat the ends 
of justice.
Background of the case
In the present case, an F.I.R. was 
lodged by the mother of the victim 
alleging that when her 6-year-old 
daughter was playing outside her 
house, the accused juvenile of age 
15 years, lured her on the pretext of 
giving toffee and after then took her 
behind a hut and committed rape 
on her.
The present matter was brought 
before the Juvenile Justice Board as 
the accused being a juvenile; wherein
his age was found about 12 years 
and 10 months in an age 
determination inquiry. However, the social 
investigation report was called, 
wherein the District Probation 
Officer observed that the boy requires 
strict control and supervision. The 
Juvenile Justice Board declined the 
bail of the juvenile and the appeal 
preferred on behalf of the juvenile 
was also dismissed. 
While challenging both the orders, 
the accused juvenile in question 
moved the instant revision petition 
before the High Court.
Court Observations
It was observed by the Court that 
to give meaning to the phrase ‘ends 
of justice’ and the matter of bail has 
to be seen literally through a prism 
having three angles, i.e., firstly, the 
angle of welfare and betterment of 
the child itself, i.e., in the best 
interest of the child, secondly, demanding 
of justice to the victim and for her 
family and thirdly, the concerns of 
society at large. 
The court while examining the 
facts and circumstances of the case 
observed that a girl of the very 
tender age of 6 years was put to violent 
sexual assault by a boy of being 
merely 15 years old after she was 
enticed in a well-planned manner by 
offering her sweets.
Accordingly, the court remarked 
as it dismissed the criminal revision 
petition, stating that the shock and 
trauma caused to an innocent girl, 
who had no understanding and inkling of the act with which she had 
to go through and the resentment 
which was caused to the members 
of her family, can easily be understood.

Union Minister of State (Independent 
Charge) Science & Technology; 
Minister of State (Independent Charge) Earth 
Sciences; MoS PMO, Personnel, Public 
Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy 
and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh today said 
that the new voters will define India 
@2047, and with the active young years 
on their side, they have the privilege and 
opportunity to contribute to the making 
of Century India, as envisaged by Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi. 
Addressing the new and young voters 
at Moradabad, Dr Jitendra Singh 
said, Uttar Pradesh is home to about 
55 million young men and women who 
are in the 18-30 age group, which is 
approximately 37 % of the total voters in 
the State.
Dr Jitendra Singh told the youth that 
a few days ago, Prime Minister Modi 
launched Rozgar Mela - the recruitment 
drive for 10 lakh personnel and during 
the ceremony, appointment letters were 
handed over to 75,000 newly inducted 
appointees. He said, in near future, the 
target of 10 lakh government jobs will 
be completed in a mission mode. 
The Minister, also appealed to the 
youth to strive for other means of 
livelihood through lucrative StartUp 
ventures and innovative entrepreneurship, 
as it is next to impossible for any 
country to provide government jobs to all. 
Referring to Prime Minister’s focus 
on the most job-intensive sectors like 
agriculture, private sector and MSME, 
Dr Jitendra Singh said, today, under the 
Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, 
a huge campaign is going on to train 
the youth according to the needs of the 
industries of the country and added 
that 1.25 crore young people have been 
trained so far all over the country.
Dr Jitendra Singh pointed out that 
initiatives like liberalising drone policy, 
opening up space policy, and 20 Lakh 
crore rupees worth of loans under 
Mudra Yojana have opened new 
opportunities for the youth.
Referring to Prime Minister’s 
continued focus on youth power since 2014, 
Dr Jitendra Singh said, on August 15, 
2017, in his Independence Day speech, 
Mr. Modi said, “January 1, 2018 will not 
be an ordinary day – those born in this 
century will start turning 18. For these 
people, this is a decisive year of their 
lives. They are going to be the creator 
of the destiny (Bhagya Vidhata) of our 
nation in the 21st century. I heartily 
welcome all these youth, honour them 
and offer my respects to them. You have 
an opportunity to shape the destiny of
our country. A proud nation invites you 
to become a part of its developmental 
journey”.
Dr Jitendra Singh said, in the 2019 
polls, 133 million young adults got the 
opportunity to vote and of them 70 
million were young men and 63 million 
young women and over 72 percent of 
them were living in India’s villages. The 
Minister said, this number may touch 
140 million by 2024, and this is India’s 
demographic dividend that should not 
be allowed to go waste.
Dr Jitendra Singh reminded the youth 
and also the administration that the 
Election Commission of India in July 
this year announced that those above 
the age of 17 years can now apply in 
advance to get enrolled in the voters’ list 
and not wait until the voting age of 18 
years.
The Commission has directed the 
chief electoral officers and electoral 
registration officers of all states to work 
out tech-based solutions to enable the 
youth to file their advance applications 
concerning three subsequent qualifying 
dates - April 1, July 1 and October 1, and 
not only just January 1. The Minister 
said, the move will boost EC’s efforts 
to enrol new young voters who turn 18 
in a year, for which an amendment was 
recently made to allow quarterly 
registration of voters.
Dr Jitendra Singh said, the Central 
government and the UP Government 
are jointly planning to hold ‘Yuva 
Vijay Sankalp Rally’ in all the nooks and 
corners of the state to make the youth 
aware of the developmental initiatives 
and achievements of the “Double Engine Sarkar

Chinese President Xi Jinping was elected as 
general secretary of the 20th 
Central Committee of the 
Communist Party of China 
(CPC) and he secured an 
unprecedented third term. 
However, the coming days 
are expected not to be easy 
for Taiwan. 
After his re-election, Geopolitica quoted Xi as saying, 
“We will safeguard the overall interests of the Chinese 
nation and take resolute 
steps to oppose “Taiwan independence” and promote 
reunification. “Resolving 
the Taiwan question must 
be resolved by the Chinese.” 
“We will continue to strive 
for peaceful reunification 
with the greatest sincerity 
and the utmost effort, but 
we will never promise to renounce the use of force, and 
we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary,” 
he added. 
Beijing has always vowed 
to unify Taiwan with the 
mainland forcefully. Even if 
we look at the past trends, 
Chinese President Xi Jinping has been asserting the 
need for “complete national 
reunification.” 
In 2017, he said “complete 
national reunification is an 
inevitable requirement for 
realising the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” 
In 2019, the Chinese leader 
reiterated the formula to reintroduce Taiwan into China 
under the idea of “one country, two systems.” The same 
formula applied to Hong 
Kong, reported Geopolitica. 
The Chinese President, 
citing reports, has already 
issued orders to the People’s 
Liberation Army (PLA) to 
remain prepared for an attack on the island by 2027. 
However, Geopolitica cited 
the US intelligence community to say that China 
might preempt the plan of 
its attack by as early as 2024. 
Incidentally, it will also coincide with the Taiwanese 
presidential elections. 
What makes Taiwan such 
an important international 
player is that the island nation is the world’s largest 
producer of semiconductor 
chips. 
Although the two countries have had problems in 
the past, the tensions intensified specifically this year 
when US House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei 
in August. 
The visit was followed by 
cyber-attacks and the largest-ever military exercise 
around Taiwan from the 
Chinese side. It also termed 
Pelosi’s visit a “dangerous, 
reckless, and irresponsible 
provocation,” reported Geopolitica. In addition to that, 
China has also tried to isolate Taiwan by forcing many 
countries to switch their 
diplomatic recognition from 
Taiwan to China in return 
for Chinese aid and investment promises, reported 
Geopolitica.
On the other hand, Taiwan 
has accused China of bribing 
politicians of other countries 
to recognise China over Taiwan, just like the case in the 
Solomon Islands and Guatemala cases.
The tension between the 
two countries has further 
intensified, ever since Tsai 
Ing-wen took over the presidency of the island nation in 
2016. Under her rule, Taiwan has gotten close to the 
US in developing submarine technology to strengthen 
its military, Geopolitica reported.

When it comes to international justice, one of the 
chapters that has been ignored for too long is 
Bangladesh’s war of liberation 
from Pakistan in 1971. The 
issue has never gotten the 
attention that it deserved 
because no ideological or 
partisan faction seemed to 
gain from it. 
However, slowly, the situation seems to be changing, 
as a resolution was recently 
placed in the US Congress to 
recognise the atrocities committed during the war. 
On October 15, a proposed 
resolution was made in the 
House of Representatives 
urging US president Joe 
Biden to consider recognising the atrocities 
committed by the Armed Forces of 
Pakistan in the Bangladesh 
Liberation War of 1971. The 
resolution was made by US 
Congressman Steve Chabot 
from the Republican party
and Congressman Ro Khanna, a Congressman of Indian 
origin from the Democratic 
party. 
The eight-page long resolution was titled “Recognising 
the Bangladesh Genocide of 
1971”, primarily focusing on 
the active role played by the 
Pakistan army along with all 
its functioning ancillary units 
in the active involvement of 
mass rape and genocide committed in 1971. 
The resolution is eight-page 
long and is titled “Recognising the Bangladesh Genocide 
of “Proud to join Rep Steve 
Chabot in introducing the 
first resolution commemorating the 1971 Bengali 
Genocide in which millions 
of ethnic Bengalis and Hindus were killed or displaced 
in one of the most forgotten 
genocides of our time,” Ro 
Khanna tweeted after the 
submission of the resolution 
on October 15. 
“We must not let the years 
erase the memory of the millions who were massacred. 
Recognising the genocide 
strengthens the historical 
record, educates our fellow 
Americans, and lets would be perpetrators know such 
crimes will not be tolerated 
or forgotten, “Chabot, a Republican Party member, said 
in a tweet.
This resolution opens up 
the forgotten floodgates 
for perhaps the most horrific crimes against 
humanity committed in 1971. Also, 
since the Awami League has 
come back to power in Dhaka, 
a new attempt of conducting 
war trials is coming up. The 
Government of Bangladesh 
declared in March 2017, that 
it would take the initiative 
to get the United Nations to 
recognise the events of 1971 
as genocide.

US State Secretary Antony 
Blinken spoke with Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Dmytro Kuleba on Tuesday and 
reaffirmed his country’s 
support for the war-ravaged 
nation as Russia continues 
to draw global attention to 
what the Kremlin says is Kyiv’s plan to use “dirty bombs” 
as a propaganda tool against 
Moscow.
Secretary of State Antony 
J. Blinken spoke today with 
Ukrainian Foreign Minister 
Dmytro Kuleba. The Secretary reaffirmed enduring 
U.S. support for Ukraine in 
the face of continued Russian aggression, atrocities, 
and rhetoric surrounding 
so-called “dirty bombs” in 
Ukraine, said State Department Spokesperson Ned 
Price. This comes amid Russian claims that Ukraine 
is preparing to use a “dirty 
bomb,” which is reportedly 
a mix of explosives with radioactive materials. A dirty 
bomb is a mix of explosives, 
such as dynamite, with 
radioactive powder or pellets. When the dynamite or 
other explosives are set off, 
the blast carries radioactive 
material into the surrounding area.
“A dirty bomb works completely differently and 
cannot create an atomic blast. 
Instead, a dirty bomb uses 
dynamite or other explosives 
to scatter radioactive dust, 
smoke, or other material in 
‘propaganda tool’
for personal reasons
order to cause radioactive 
contamination, “according 
to the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention.” On Sunday, Russian 
Defense Minister Sergei 
Shoygu spoke to the defence 
ministers of the UK, the US 
and France to warn about 
the ‘dirty bomb’ threat posed 
by Ukraine. 
In a joint statement, the 
three countries said, “Our 
countries made clear that 
we all reject Russia’s transparently false allegations 
that Ukraine is preparing to 
use a dirty bomb on its own 
territory. The world will see 
through any attempt to use 
this allegation as a pretext 
for escalation. We further 
reject any pretext for escalation by Russia. “ 
Meanwhile, Russia has 
asked UN chief Antonio 
Guterres to do everything 
he can to prevent Ukraine 
from carrying out its “dirty 
bomb” provocation. “We 
call on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to 
do everything in his power 
to prevent this heinous 
crime from happening,” the 
letter reads. 
“We will regard the use of 
the ‘dirty bomb’ by the Kyiv 
regime as an act of nuclear 
terrorism,” the Russian 
Permanent Representative 
to the United Nations, Vasily Nebenzya, said in a letter 
seen by TASS. “These allegations are false,” a senior 
Defense Department official 
told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday.

The recent attack on a school 
van in northwest Paki- 
stan, along with the spike 
in militancy, has given rise 
to fears that the outlawed 
Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan 
(TTP) is gaining ground in 
the country. On December 
16, 2014, six terrorists affiliated with TTP attacked the 
Army Public School in the 
northwest city of Peshawar. 
Over 147 people, including 
132 children, were killed in 
the attack. The TTP created 
havoc in Pakistan with several attacks between 2007 
and 2014. The TTP members 
had fled to Afghanistan after 
Islamabad launched widescale operations against the 
group following the Peshawar attack.
But recent Pakistan media 
reports have published reports that suggest the 
resurgence of the outlawed group. 
In an interview with Amsterdam-based think tank 
EFSAS, Fazal Khan, a human rights activist, lawyer, 
and founding member of the 
Pashtun Tahafuz Movement 
(PTM), recalled how his son 
was killed among more than 
140 others during the 2014 
Peshawar school massacre. 
Born and educated in Peshawar, Khan has developed a 
passion for empowering 
marginalised individuals 
and communities, including 
during his time at university. 
The killing of Khan’s son has 
driven his continued focus 
on human rights activism 
and his pursuit of justice for 
the children killed during 
the 2014 massacre. 
While speaking with the 
European Foundation for 
South Asian Studies (EFSAS), Khan stated that “no 
words could explain” the 
trauma he incurred by the 
killing of his eldest son and 
described the pain of examining the bodies that arrived 
at the hospital in the search 
for his child. 
Khan highlighted the unusual behaviour of Pakistani 
authorities in the build-up to 
the attack, during the attack, 
and following it, including 
the focus on enabling international rather than local 
news coverage. 
Notably, the shootings took 
place in a school located in a 
cantonment in Peshawar 
that usually registered a 
high military presence, raising suspicions as to how the 
attack was permitted to happen. Pakistani authorities 
were initially unclear about 
the number of attackers. 
“Every parent wanted to 
how come these terrorists 
were in a containment area 
Peshawar is a very strategically located city and school 
is surrounded by office and 
the house of Corps commander,” he told EFSAS. 
According to Khan, the 
shootings were carried out 
by terrorists but facilitated 
by the Pakistani military establishment.
He bases this claim on assailants not targeting 
military personnel and established school schedules not 
being followed by the school, 
resulting in the physical concentration of children in the 
spaces where the shootings 
would take place.
In an additional indication of a potential 
complicity of the Army, Khan noted 
that the security forces that 
arrived at the school in response to the attack were 
denied access by the Army 
personnel present at the 
scene. 
The Judicial Commission, 
established only with significant delay, has failed to 
make gathered information 
publicly accessible.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has 
until Friday to close his USD 
44 billion Twitter acquisi- 
tion deal or face a trial, reported CNN Business. 
The clock is ticking as billionaire Musk has till 5 p.m. 
ET on Friday to close the 
deal. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO 
Elon Musk is being investigated by the US federal 
authorities in connection with 
his USD 44 billion Twitter 
buyout deal, said media reports citing a court filing 
by the microblogging site. 
However, the Twitter court 
filing did not go into details 
of the ongoing probe as to 
what actions taken by the 
business magnate are being 
investigated by the officials, 
reported CNN.
In the court filing, Twitter 
without delving into details 
of the matter, simply said 
that they are looking into 
Musk’s “conduct” linked to 
the deal. The main scrutiny 
seems to be on Musk’s legal team. Twitter accused 
Musk’s legal team of failing 
to produce draft communications with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission 
and a slide presentation to 
the Federal Trade Commission. This is part of the two 
sides’ ongoing litigation 
over whether Musk can 
walk away from the deal, reported CNN.
Reacting to the Twitter filing, Musk’s attorney Alex 
Spiro said that the filing 
only aims to digress from 
its own legal issues which
came to the surface by 
whistleblower disclosure. 
The former Twitter security chief Peiter Zatko last 
month made allegations on 
Twitter of wrongdoings including “Twitter’s tracking 
and measurement of user 
engagement.”
“Twitter’s executives are 
under federal investigation,” Spiro said in a 
statement to CNN. “This misdirection was sent by Twitter 
to try and uncover which of 
their assorted misconduct 
they are under investigation 
for.” In July, in a surprising 
turn of events, Elon Musk 
who had long been showing his interest to buy 
Twitter terminated the deal. The 
Tesla CEO did so by alleging 
that Twitter violated their 
mutual purchase agreement by misrepresenting 
the number of spam and 
fake bot accounts on its 
platform. After Musk put 
out the deal termination 
announcement, the market 
saw a sharp decline. Later, 
Twitter sued Musk accusing him of using bots as a 
pretext to exit a dea.

Comedian Trevor 
Noah put up a defence for new British 
leader Rishi Sunak after the 
first Indian-origin prime 
minister of the country was 
questioned by some racists 
over his non-white origins. 
Trevor Noah on his ‘Daily 
Show’ played a clip from a 
British radio show in which 
a caller explained why a nonwhite person becoming the 
PM of the UK is not a good 
thing. In response, Noah 
said, Rishi Sunak is an Indian, he is Hindu and 
only forty-two, which means he will 
probably “serve well into his 
forty-two-and-a-halves”. He 
added, “Let’s not forget another important first. He is 
also the first prime minister 
who is an absolute snack.” 
Talking about the issue, 
Noah stated that not everyone in the UK is happy 
about Mr Sunak becoming 
the prime minister. The host 
played the clip of the caller 
where he was heard say- 
ing, “Can you imagine me 
becoming Prime Minister of 
Scottish National or me becoming the Prime Minister 
of Pakistan? People of England would like to see some- 
one who looks like them,” 
Noah responded in a hilarious way to racist remark, he 
said, “This is a good point. 
Can you imagine white 
English people trying to 
rule countries where no one 
looks like them?” He also 
stated that British racist are 
looking at it the wrong way, 
“this could be a good thing 
for you people. After 400 
years, you finally get to legitimately blame a brown 
person for your country’s 
problems. You’re living the 
dream. Wake up”
Earlier both Rishi Sunak 
and home secretary Suella 
Braverman were subjected 
to heavy criticism when 
they announced their bid to 
contest for the post of Prime 
Minister. While Sunak was 
questioned over his wealth 
and alleged tax evasion of 
his wife, Suella was labelled 
as an outsider. 
British Television presenter Sangita Myska 
eviscerated a racist caller on her 
show who had claimed that 
Tory members won’t vote 
for Sunak since he ‘Doesn’t 
represents Britain’ . 
Sunak was elected as the 
Prime Minister of UK after former PM Liz truss 
resigned after a short stint 
of 45 days, thereby making him first Indian-origin 
and Hindu Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. 
Later on Tuesday, he was appointed the prime minister 
of Britain by King Charles

After several governments in the West imposed 
economic sanctions on Russia for 
invading Ukraine, Russia offered discounts 
on its oil, which was immediately grabbed 
by China.
Even before the Ukraine war, China 
was one of the largest buyers of Russian 
oil. But, once the Russian attack 
on Ukraine started, Beijing’s purchases of oil 
from Moscow only increased. 
Although China chose not to condemn 
Russia’s attacks on Ukraine for economic 
interests publicly, it has called for an early end 
to the war trying to act as a friend to both 
Ukraine and Russia.
China has defended the purchase of oil 
from Russia, saying it must source crude 
oil from wherever it is available at a cheap 
rate. China also continues to buy oil from 
the Middle East as well as Angola and 
Brazil, although in July, Russia remained its 
top supplier for the third month in a row. 
From March to May, China bought 14.5 
million barrels of oil, which marks a three-fold 
increase from the same period last year.
The adverse impact of the covid-19 
pandemic on the global economy has knocked oil 
prices and futures contracts down to levels 
not seen in decades. 
Under the current scenario, diplomatic 
relations between Russia and China are 
getting stronger as Russia becomes 
totally dependent on China. China’s imports 
from Russia jumped a record 80% in May 
last year, Portal Plus quoted Oksana 
Lesnyak, Head of the Asia-Pacific Bureau of 
the Kyiv-based Center for Global Studies 
Strategy XXI However, China too is 
experiencing financial difficulties due to its 
covid-19 lockdowns and property crisis. 
So, if it gets an opportunity to fill in its soil 
reserves by purchasing cheaper oil, it will 
definitely take advantage of that opportunity. 
“Lots of these things can be done more 
constructively behind the scenes than in 
the limelight,” China expert Victor Gao, a 
professor at China’s Soochow University 
and vice president of the Center for China 
and Globalization, was quoted as saying. 
“As this relationship develops, Russia’s 
position will become weaker, hence China will be 
pushing for higher discounts on Russian oil 
and gas exports,” he added.

Russia has notified The 
United States about its plans 
to carry out the annual exercises of its nuclear forces, 
the US government reported on Tuesday.
Pentagon Press Secretary, 
Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat 
Ryder, in a press briefsing, 
said, “The US was notified, 
and, as we’ve highlighted 
before, this is a routine annual exercise by Russia.” 
The move came amid Russia’s claim this week that 
Ukraine could use a so-called “dirty bomb” on its 
own territory. It is seen by 
analysts as a new attempt 
to stoke fear of nuclear 
escalation among Kyiv’s 
backers, if not a pure one 
and a simple distraction. 
Meanwhile, the US and 
other Western officials 
have dismissed Moscow’s 
claim that Ukraine plans to 
use a so-called dirty bomb 
as a Russian false-flag operation. A “dirty bomb” is 
a conventional bomb laced 
with radioactive, biological, 
or chemical materials dispersed in an explosion. 
The terms are frequently 
used interchangeably with 
radiological dispersal device 
(RDD), a bomb that uses radioactive materials.In a joint 
statement, the US, France, 
and Britain three of the 
other nuclear powers on 
the United Nations Security 
Council said that 
Russia’s claims were “transparently false.”. 
They and Kyiv suspect 
that Russia might use a dirty 
bomb in a “false flag” attack, 
possibly to justify Moscow’s 
use of conventional nuclear 
weapons as it finds itself on 
the back foot in eastern and 
southern Ukraine. 
The United States has said 
it expects Russia to carry 
out test launches of missiles 
during its annual “Grom” 
exercises of its strategic nuclear forces. Under the New 
START Treaty, Russia is 
obliged to provide advance 
notification of such missile 
launches. The New START 
(Strategic Arms Reduction 
Treaty) was the last remaining arms reduction pact 
between the former Cold War 
rivals.

The United Nations has taken a grim view of the recent 
death of Pakistani journalist 
Arshad Sharif. The United 
Nations has demanded 
a thorough investigation 
from the Kenyan authorities 
into the case of the death of 
Pakistani journalist Arshad 
Sharif, reported Dawn on 
Wednesday. Sharif was reportedly killed on Monday 
in a shooting incident in 
Kenya.
While talking to journalists, the Spokesperson for UN 
Secretary-General, Stephane 
Dujarric said “I saw this tragic report of his death. I think 
the circumstances need to 
be investigated thoroughly, 
and the Kenyan authorities 
said they would.” Earlier on 
Tuesday, the United States 
strongly condemned the 
killing of Arshad Sharif and 
demanded a full investigation 
by the government of Kenya 
into the incident.
US State Department 
spokesperson Ned Price 
expressed condolences to 
Sharif ’s family members 
and his loved ones, and to 
all those who knew him, reported The Nation. He said, 
“We are deeply saddened by 
the death of Arshad Sharif.” 
Ned Price also talked about 
protecting journalists and the 
right to freedom of expression. He praised Arshad’s 
work saying “His work was 
known around the world.” 
US State Department 
spokesperson demanded a 
full investigation by the government of Kenya into 
Arshad Sharif ’s death. He said 
“It’s not entirely clear that we 
know all the circumstances 
at this point regarding what 
led to his death, but we urge 
a full investigation,” reported 
The Nation.
Earlier on Monday, Arshad 
Sharif ’s wife Javeria Siddique 
informed that her husband 
died in Kenya after being 
shot. “I lost a friend, husband 
and my favourite journalist @ 
arsched today, as per police he 
was shot in Kenya. Respect 
our privacy and in the name 
of breaking pls don’t share 
our family pics, personal 
details and his last pictures 
from the hospital. Remember 
us in our prayers,” Sharif ’s 
wife Javeria Siddique said in 
a Twitter post.
Several journalists and politicians across Pakistan have 
condoled the death of senior 
Pakistani journalist Arshad 
Sharif who was reportedly 
shot dead in Kenya. 
Prime Minister Shehbaz 
Sharif also spoke to the late 
journalist’s mother over the 
phone, sympathised with 
the family, and expressed his 
grief over the incident, reported Dawn. Pakistan Tehreek- 
e-Insaaf (PTI) chief Imran 
Khan has called slain journalist Arshad Sharif ‘martyr’ and 
alleged that he was a victim of 
‘targeted killing’. Earlier, the 
Kenyan authorities said that 
police shot Sharif in case of 
mistaken identity. However, 
Sharif ’s family has outrightly 
rejected the claim and demanded an independent 
inquiry, reported Dawn.

With the economic situation looking gloomy in 
Pakistan and the country being 
downgraded by Fitch and 
Moody’s, the International 
Monetary Fund has called 
on the nation to impose additional taxes worth PKR 
600 billion, reported Express Tribune on Tuesday. 
The IMF has estimated 
that Pakistan may have 
to take additional revenue measures equal to 
0.75% of Pakistan’s GDP, 
which is around 600 billion PKR. Although the 
Forex reserves of the State 
Bank of Pakistan (SBP) 
currently stand at $7.6bn, 
out of the total reserves, 
$2.3bn was credited by 
China, $3bn deposited by 
Saudi Arabia, and $1.2bn 
came from the IMF. 
Even though Pakistan has 
received about $30 billion 
in remittances in the fiscal year 2022, it has not 
managed to keep its current account deficit in 
control, as it still needs 
around $32 billion this fiscal year to make payments 
against foreign obligations. 
Foreign obligations, as well 
as rising inflation, are increasing the cost of living 
for the local population.Fair 
Observer, citing the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics 
said that inflation in Pakistan peaked at a historic 
high of 27.3% in August. But 
there is a large gap between 
actual inflation and the government’s inflation target 
of 11.5% for this fiscal year. 
The prices of daily commodities are also getting out 
of people’s budgets. While 
the cost of onions has almost 
doubled, cooking oil prices 
have risen by around 83%. 
The floods in Pakistan, 
which destroyed almost 
40% of the standing crops, 
are being considered one of 
the prime reasons for such
a massive rate of inflation 
in the country. The Fair 
Observer, citing the World 
Bank, said that the rate of 
poverty in Pakistan has 
surged from 2.5% to 4%, 
which has taken the num- 
ber of people in poverty 
from 5.8 million to 9 million. 
According to Business Re- 
corder, Federal Minister for 
Finance and Revenue Muhammad Ishaq Dar, during 
the question hour session in 
National Assembly on Monday, said that the outstand- 
ing public debt of Pakistan 
was 49.2 trillion PKR at 
the end of June 2022. He 
further said that the country faces a domestic debt 
of 31.04 trillion and an external debt of 18.16 trillion. 
So the chance of Pakistan’s 
being able to implement 
the IMF recommendations 
looks gloomy as the government is already facing 
heavy criticism on the front 
of rising inflation and increasing cost of living.

After the Chinese government said it has “overlapping 
claims” with Vietnam over 
maritime rights in parts of 
the East Sea, Indonesia rubbished the statement, rejected 
China’s offer for any negotiations and said that Jakarta’s 
economic interests are threatened by China’s Nine-Dash 
Line.
China’s permanent mission to the UN in a letter 
said, “There is no territorial dispute between China 
and Indonesia in the South 
China Sea. However, China 
and Indonesia have overlapping claims on maritime 
rights and interests in some 
parts of the South China Sea,” 
reported Vietnam Times. 
“China is willing to settle the 
overlapping claims through 
negotiation and consultation 
with Indonesia, and work 
together with Indonesia to 
maintain peace and stability 
in the South China Sea,” the
letter said.
This came when the Chinese government, in a letter 
to UN Secretary-General 
Antonio Guterres on June 2, 
claimed that there is no territorial dispute with Indonesia 
and rather the two countries 
had overlapping claims over 
maritime rights in parts of the 
East Sea, reported Vietnam 
Times.
Reacting to this, Damos 
Dumoli Agusman, Director 
General of international law 
and treaties at Indonesia’s 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
told BenarNews, that there is 
no relevance in holding any 
dialogue on maritime boundary delimitation.
“Based on the United Na- 
tions Convention on the Law 
of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982 Indonesia does not have over- 
lapping claims with the PRC, 
so it is not relevant to hold any 
dialogue on maritime boundary delimitation,” he said. “It

the spokesperson of China’s

King Charles offered 
Diwali sweets to UK 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as he performe
his duty as head of state and 
formally appointed the new 
Conservative leader, an event 
which also coincided with 
the occasion of the most celebrated five-day “Festival of 
Lights” celebrated this week 
by Hindus, Sikhs and Jains, 
marking the triumph of good 
over evil.
The two met in the palace’s lavish 1844 Room, and 
on a table was a selection 
of sweets that are eaten to 
celebrate Diwali, wrote The 
Royal Family Channel on its 
Twitter account.
After Sunak rose to power, 
the event prompted a sense 
of pride among Indians. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also offered 
him “special” Diwali wishes 
as the “living bridge” of UK 
Indians.
Sunak, whose parents 
came to the UK from East 
Africa in the 1960s, is of 
Indian descent. His father 
was a local doctor while his 
mother ran a pharmacy in 
southern England, something Sunak says gave him 
his desire to serve the public. 
He became the first Hindu 
to become British prime 
minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of 
lights that marks one of the 
most important days of the 
Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 
when he lit Diwali candles 
outside 11 Downing Street, 
the official residence of the 
UK chancellor.
He has faced challenges 
over his elite background, 
having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, 
Oxford and Stanford universities. He is known for 
his expensive taste in fashion 
and has worked for banks 
and hedge funds, including 
Goldman Sachs.
Sunak’s election on Monday marks the pinnacle of 
what has been a speedy 
rise to power. He was first 
elected as an MP in 2015 and 
spent two years on the back 
benches before becoming a 
junior minister in Theresa 
May’s government. Johnson 
gave Sunak his first major 
government role, appointing him as chief secretary 
to the Treasury in 2019 and 
promoting him to chancellor 
in 2020.
He was the first person 
who ‘predicted’ financial 
problems under Truss. He 
clashed with the former PM 
during the previous leadership race, claiming her plan 
to borrow money during an 
inflation crisis was a “fairytale” that would plunge 
the economy into chaos. 
Sunak was first elected as 
an MP in 2015—for Richmond in north Yorkshire 
but rose quickly, and was 
made finance minister or 
chancellor in February 
2020 under Boris Johnson. 
Sunak was in charge of Covid support cash, the financial 
aid during lockdowns, including furlough payments 
and the “Eat Out to Help 
Out” scheme for restaurants. 
His wife is Akshata Murthy, the daughter of Indian 
billionaire Narayana Murthy. He faced controversy 
over his wife’s tax arrangements.
Over the summer, it 
emerged Akshata Murthy 
paid no UK tax on her big 
earnings abroad which is legal.
Sunak defended his wife, 
saying, “to smear my wife 
to get at me is awful” but 
eventually she agreed to start 
paying extra taxes.
 It was also found he temporarily had a US green 
card, allowing him to live 
permanently in America 
while he was the UK’s chancellor.
He campaigned for Brexit 
and deregulation. “Free 
ports” are one of his longtime favourite ideas: areas 
near ports or airports where 
goods can be imported and 
exported without paying 
taxes, to encourage trade. 
In 2016, he told a group 
of schoolchildren that he 
originally wanted to be a Jedi 
Knight when he grew up. His 
favourite Star Wars film is 
The Empire Strikes Back. 
However, Sunak faces an 
enormous task. 
The UK is in the midst of a 
deep cost-of-living crisis and 
soaring inequality. 
Financial markets are still 
spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.

Many vertebrates use vocalisations to 
communicate. Some well-known examples include singing birds, 
croaking frogs, and barking dogs. These 
vocalisations are crucial to parenting, 
mate attraction, and a number of other 
behaviours.
Little is known about when and 
where this behaviour emerged in 
vertebrates’ evolution despite its significance. Comparative analyses can 
shed light on the evolutionary history 
of acoustic communication, but they 
frequently lack data from important 
groups that have not received enough 
attention.
acoustic abilities are 
widespread in land vertebrates:
Thus, a multidisciplinary research 
team under the direction of the University of Zurich (UZH) has concen- 
trated on previously unexplored species. They used vocal recordings and 
contextual behavioural data to support 
their claims that 53 species of four major clades of land vertebrates 
turtles, 
tuataras, caecilians, and lungfishes
belong to these groups.
According to first author Gabriel 
Jorgewich-Cohen, a PhD candidate 
at the Paleontological Institute and 
Museum of UZH, “This, along with a 
broad literature-based dataset includ- 
ing 1800 different species covering 
the entire spectrum, shows that vocal communication is not only 
widespread in land vertebrates but also 
evidences acoustic abilities in several 
groups previously considered nonvocal.” For instance, many turtles that 
were previously believed to be mute 
are now actually displaying extensive 
and sophisticated acoustic repertoires.
last common ancestor 
lived about 407 million 
years ago:
The researchers combined pertinent 
information on the vocalisation abilities of species like lizards, snakes, 
salamanders, amphibians, and dipnoi 
with phylogenetic trait reconstruction techniques in order to look into 
the evolutionary history of acoustic 
communication in vertebrates. The researchers were able to 
map vocal communication in the vertebrate tree of life 
using data from well-known acoustic 
clades like mammals, birds, and frogs. 
According to Marcelo Sanchez, the 
study’s lead author, “We were able to 
reconstruct acoustic communication 
as a shared trait among these animals, 
which is at least as old as their last 
common ancestor that lived approximately 
407 million years before present.”
acoustic communication 
did not evolve multiple 
times:
Since the morphology of the hearing 
apparatus, its sensitivity, and the vocal 
tract vary greatly among vertebrates, 
the scientific consensus has thus far 
supported a convergent origin for 
acoustic communication among vertebrates. However, 
the UZH researchers claim that the evidence for this 
hypothesis is lacking pertinent information from important species that 
have previously been overlooked or 
thought to be non-vocal. 
According to Sanchez’s findings, 
“Our results now show that acoustic 
communication did not evolve multiple times in diverse clades, but has 
a common and ancient evolutionary 
origin.”

The cast of filmmaker James 
Cameron’s upcoming sci-fi 
film ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ was thoroughly trained 
to film underwater scenes as 
the director wanted them to 
feel real.
According to Variety, 
though Kate Winslet left 
everyone involved with the 
long-awaited sequel stunned

Zoe Saldana was certainly 
no rookie.
Cameron had "the world's

he could film extended long

Winslet held her breath for

Union Minister of 
Road, Transport 
and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, has been advocating the use of ethanol 
blended fuels and flex fuel 
engines in vehicles. This in 
his opinion will cut India’s 
fuel import bills drastically 
and will also help in reducing vehicular pollution. 
One of the first automakers to have worked in that 
direction is Toyota, which 
has launched the pilot project on Flexi-Fuel Strong 
Hybrid Electric Vehicle 
Technology in the country. During the launch, the 
Toyota Corolla Altis FFVSHEV, that has been 
imported from Toyota Brazil 
for the pilot project was 
This initiative marks Toyota’s first step to promote 
and create awareness on 
Ethanol as an important 
indigenous, carbon neutral energy pathway, along 
with the advanced Strong 
Hybrid Electric Vehicle 
technology of Toyota that 
can help India achieve selfreliance and contribute 
towards the national target of 
Carbon Net-Zero by 2070. 
Further, as a part of this 
project, collected data will 
be shared with the Indian 
Institute of Science, for 
unveiled.                                       
carbon emissions of Flexi 
Fuel and Strong Hybrid vehicles in the Indian context. 
In this regard, a Memorandum of Understanding was 
also signed between Toyota 
Kirloskar Motor (TKM) 
and the Indian Institute of 
Science, Bangalore. 
As one of the most appropriate solutions, 
ethanol holds tremendous 
potential for India as it is 
an Indigenous and clean 
energy source, that can 
significantly reduce fossil 
fuel consumption, the energy import bill and carbon 
emissions. Being agriculture based, higher use of 
ethanol as fuel will also increase farmer incomes and 
create new jobs, thereby 
boosting the rural economy 
besides increasing revenue 
for the Government from 
surplus sugar and food 
grains.
The Government has recently launched 
second-generation technologies 
for producing ethanol from 
agricultural residues like 
parali, which is currently 
otherwise burnt. This 
possibility will not only 
prevent severe air pollution but also help generate 
wealth from waste.  India has already achieved 
10% ethanol blending five 
months ahead of schedule. 
The implementation of 
20% ethanol blending in 
petrol by 2025-26 is expected to substitute 86 million 
barrels of Gasoline, thereby 
leading to forex savings 
of Rs. 30,000 crores for 
India, as well as reducing 10 Million tons of 
carbon emissions. Given the 
huge potential of ethanol 
production that exists up 
to and beyond E20, these 
13
benefits can increase multifold with the introduction 
of Flexi Fuel Vehicle (FFV) 
technology, that can flexibly use higher ethanol 
blends from 20% to 85%. 
 Globally, many countries 
like Brazil have hugely 
benefited from large scale 
introduction of Flexi-fuel 
vehicles. In fact, in Brazil 
an innovative Flexi fuelstrong Hybrid electric 
vehicle technology has been 
introduced by Toyota 
Brazil, which has the lowest Well-to-Wheel (W2W) 
carbon emissions for any 
technology in the country. 
An FFV–SHEV has a Flexi 
Fuel engine and an electric 
powertrain, thus providing 
dual benefit of higher ethanol use and greater fuel 
efficiency, as it can run for 
significant time periods on 
its EV mode, wherein the 
engine is shut off. The FFVSHEV has much higher 
economic multiplier benefits, as it can hasten local 
manufacturing of electric 
and flexi-fuel powertrain 
parts, thus providing a 
disruption free & low risk 
industry and energy transition. As this technology 
provides the opportunity 
to benefit from both electrification and bio-fuel 
energy pathways, it enables 
a faster reduction of fossil 
fuel consumption, CO2 
emissions, as well as boosting the agrarian economy. 
There are many green energy pathways in electrifica- 
tion and alternate fuels that 
can help the transportation 
sector lower its dependence 
on fossil fuels, along with 
reducing carbon footprint. 
According to Toyota clean 
technologies should be introduced based on each 
country’s unique requirements and context, so as to 
the daily guardian review

minimize fossil fuel usage 
and achieve carbon reduction in the fastest possible 
time. 
Towards this direction, 
given India’s energy mix, 
its unique consumer profile 
and needs, infrastructure 
readiness, and the Government’s diversified efforts 
towards becoming ‘Atma 
Nirbhar’ in energy by 2047, 
Toyota says it is advancing 
solutions with greater agility, thereby introducing and 
supporting multiple clean 
technology pathways.

Rain played spoilsport in England’s 
already shaky 
chase, helping Ireland defeat the former champions 
by five runs as per Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) 
method in the Group 1, 
Super 12 match of the ICC 
T20 World Cup at Melbourne Cricket Ground 
(MCG) on Wednesday. 
With this win, Ireland has 
climbed to fourth position in 
points table with two points 
and one win in two matches. 
England sits at third position 
with two points and one win 
in two matches. Chasing 158, 
England’s hard-hitting top 
order faced an implosion yet 
again. Medium pacer Josh 
Little dismissed dangerous 
opener Jos Buttler (0) and 
Alex Hales (7), reducing England to 14/2 in their 2.4 overs. 
Dawid Malan started off 
playing some good shots, but 
England lost yet another star 
batter as Ben Stokes’ stumps 
were castled by medium pacer Fionn Hand for just 6 off 8 
balls. The former champions 
were reduced to 29/3. 
Malan was joined by 
youngster Harry Brook and 
both took England through 
the remainder of the powerplay safely. In six overs, 
England was at 37/3, with 
Malan (15*) and Brook (3*) at 
the crease.
England reached the 50-run mark in 8.5 overs. The 
duo started to build a partnership, taking England’s 
chase in the right direction. 
At the end of 10 overs, England was at 63/3, with Malan 
(23*) and Brook (17*).
In the 11th over, Ireland 
missed two great chances to 
strengthen their hold on the 
match by dropping Brook 
and Malan in two consecutive balls. However, Gerath 
Arshdeep Singh
Delany undid the damage 
caused by catching Brook 
for 18 off 21 balls, breaking 
the 38-run stand between 
Brook and Malan. George 
Dockrell got his first wicket 
of the match.
All-rounder Moeen Ali 
joined Malan at the other 
end and two southpaws had 
to guide England towards 
another victory. Malan, who 
had been holding together 
England’s innings till this 
point, was dismissed by Barry McCarthy for 35 off 37 balls 
after being caught by Fionn 
Hand. Half of the English batting lineup was back in the hut 
for 86/5.
Ali was joined by Liam Livingstone. Ali helped England 
cross the 100-run mark in 14.2 
overs. Rain interrupted play 
at this point. England were 5 
runs behind the par score of 
110 as they had scored 105/5 
in 14.3 overs, with Ali (24*) 
and Livingstone (1*). The action could not start and rain 
exceeded the cut-off time. 
As a result, Ireland won the 
match by five runs. Little (2/16) 
was the pick of the bowlers for 
Ireland. McCarthy, Hand and 
Dockrell took one wicket each.
Earlier, fiery spells by Liam 
Livingstone and Mark Wood 
helped England bundle out 
Ireland for 157 in Super 12s 
of the ongoing T20 World 
Cup 2022 in Melbourne on 
Wednesday.
Balbirnie top scored for Ireland with 62 off 47 while 
Lorcan Tucker played a knock 
of 34 runs. For England, Livingstone, Wood bagged three 
while Sam Curran claimed 
two wickets.
Put to bat first, Ireland got off 
to a bad start as they lost the 
crucial wicket of opener Paul 
Stirling. Mark Wood gave his 
team a big breakthrough as he 
dismissed danger man Stirling, who hit the ball straight 
into the hands of Sam Curran. 
Lorcan Tucker then came 
out to bat. In the 4th over, he 
slammed Chris Woakes for 11 
runs hammering two fours in 
the over. Tucker continued his 
blistering form and took Sam 
Curran for 14 runs in the 6th 
over of the innings. Tucker 
along with Ireland’s skipper 
guided the team to 92/1 at the 
halfway stage of the game. 
Balbirnie also shifted gears 
and slammed Chris Woakes 
for 18, slamming two fours 
and one six. Tucker’s stint 
at the crease was cut short 
when he was run out at the 
non-striker’s end, with Adil 
Rashid deflecting the ball to 
the stumps off a drive from 
Andrew Balbirnie. Tucker 
went back to the pavilion, 
after scoring 34 runs in 27 
balls, in the 12th over of the 
innings.
Harry Tector then came 
out to bat, but could not do 
much as he was dismissed 
by Mark Wood without 
scoring runs.
Curtis Campher then 
joined hands with Balbirnie 
to keep the moumentum 
going. Ireland skipper Andrew Balbirnie brought up 
his half-century in 40 balls. 
In the 16th over of the innings, Liam Livingstone 
struck twice to dismiss wellset batter Balbirnie for 62 
runs and new batter George 
Dockrell for a duck. 
Gareth Delany then came 
out to bat. Mark Wood gave 
another blow to Ireland as 
he dismissed Campher for 
17 off 11 in the 17th over of 
the game. In the 18th over of 
the game, Livingstone struck 
again to remove Mark Adair 
for 4. At this point, Ireland 
kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Sam Curran 
then gave Ireland a double 
blow as he dismissed Barry 
McCarthy for three runs and 
Fionn Hand for one. Ben 
Stokes then bundled out Ireland for 157 as he dismissed 
Joshua Little for a duck.

Former India skipper Virat 
Kohli climbed 5 positions to 
reach number 9 position in the 
latest ICC Men’s Player Rankings, after his heroics against 
Pakistan at the ongoing ICC 
Men’s T20 World Cup. 
Kohli played an unbeaten 
knock of 82 runs to guide 
Men in Blue to a memorable 
final-ball victory over Pakistan in Melbourne on Sunday 
and that knock has catapulted the ‘Chasemaster’ back 
inside the top 10 for batters The 33-year-old’s knock was 
decorated with six fours and 
four giant sixes during his glorious 53-ball stay at the iconic 
Melbourne Cricket Ground 
(MCG), and he duly cruised 
up five spots to ninth on the 
latest set of player rankings 
that were released by the ICC 
on Wednesday. Pakistan batter Mohammad Rizwan 
remains on top of the batter list, 
but there is a new challenger 
to the top spot as New Zealand opener Devon Conway 
rises three places to second 
following his unbeaten 92 
against Australia at the T20 
World Cup.
Conway hammered the 
Australian attack to all parts 
of the Sydney Cricket Ground 
(SCG) during his 58-ball innings as he and Finn Allen 
(42 off 16) combined to put 
the reigning T20 World Cup 
champions on the back foot in 
the first match of the Super 12s 
on Saturday.
The innings see Conway 
jump past India’s Suryakumar Yadav, Pakistan skipper 
Babar Azam and South Africa 
veteran Aiden Markram and 
within striking space to challenge Rizwan for the top spot 
at a career-high rating of 831 
rating points. 
Allen too is on the move, 
with his swashbuckling innings against Australia 
helping him enhance a whopping 
17 places to equal 13th overall 
on the list for batters.

Bangladesh captain Shakib 
Al Hasan said that team’s 
ODI series win against 
South Africa earlier this 
year will give them confidence ahead of their 
T20 World Cup match on 
Thursday at Sydney Cricket 
Ground.
“It is a very important 
match for both sides but for 
South Africa, who would 
have expected two points 
from their first game, this 
is a do-or-die match. They 
will be under some pressure. 
We have a win under 
our belt, and now we will 
be playing at a ground that 
normally aids the spinners. 
The ICC usually tries to 
produce true wickets in the 
World Cup so that everyone 
gets help,” ESPNcricinfo 
quoted Shakib as saying. 
“They have a number of 
world-class players on 
their side, but we will try 
to the best of our ability. We 
have some good memories 
against them recently, albeit in another format. It will 
certainly help us mentally. 
We want to be clear-mind- 
ed and enjoy the game. We 
are hopeful of a big crowd 
since Sydney has a huge 
Bangladeshi population,” 
he added.
Shakib is confident that 
Bangladesh can stop South 
Africa’s pace attack, especially after openers Soumya 
Sarkar and Najmul Hossain 
Shanto got them off to a fast 
start against the Netherlands, adding 43 runs in 5.1 
overs for the first wicket. 
“The opening stand will 
give us confidence. Both 
openers were quite positive 
[against the Netherlands], 
which was more important 
than the runs they scored. 
We should play with more 
freedom now. We have 
played against the South 
African pacers recently. We 
know what they can do, and 
we have been successful in 
ODIs. I think we can counter their plans and have the 
upper hand,” said the Bangladesh captain.
He also praised the Bangladesh pace attack, 
particularly Taskin Ahmed 
for his strong bowling 
performance against the 
Netherlands. “[Taskin] is 
one of the leaders now after Mashrafe’s exit. He has 
done tremendously well in 
the last two years for Bangladesh. He is leading by 
example. We have a very 
good fast bowling group in 
all three formats. I can’t be 
more proud of how they 
have improved themselves 
and come this far, and it 
is showing in the results. 
I hope they continue their 
form in this World Cup,” 
said Shakib.

Ahead of his team’s match 
against India at the ongoing 
ICC T20 World Cup. Netherlands skipper Scott Edwards 
said that it is surreal that 
their side is getting to play 
India at the iconic Sydney 
Cricket Ground (SCG) and 
players are looking forward 
to it.
India will take on the 
Netherlands in their Group 
2, Super 12 phase match of 
the ICC T20 World Cup on 
Thursday. “It is huge. You 
dream of playing in the 
World Cups. SCG is one of 
the most famous grounds 
and you are playing against 
arguably one of the best sides 
in the world. It is pretty surreal and the boys are looking 
forward to it,” said Edwards 
during a pre-match press 
conference.
Edwards said that Men in 
Blue are a high-quality unit 
and it is focusing on putting 
great performance against 
them and taking things one 
game at a time.
The skipper also said that 
the Netherlands is focusing 
on playing their own brand 
of cricket instead of playing 
like top teams like India and 
Australia.
Edwards hoped that team’s 
experienced batter Tom Cooper will be among the runs 
against India.
Asked if he had watched 
India’s thrilling campaign 
opener against Pakistan, 
Edwards said, “It was an 
unbelievable game of cricket.  
after round one
India and Pakistan always 
put up great matches. What 
Virat Kohli did was surreal.” 
India started their T20 
World Cup campaign with 
a thrilling four-wicket win 
over Pakistan at the iconic 
Melbourne Cricket Ground, 
in which Virat Kohli shined 
with an unbeaten 82* off 53 
balls and Hardik Pandya 
also put up an all-round 
performance of 40 and 
3/30. Arshdeep Singh also 
took 3/32 in his first World 
Cup match, helping restrict 
Pakistan to 159/8.

*
India bowling coach 
Paras Mhambrey 
on Tuesday heaped 
praise on young pace 
sensation Arshdeep 
Singh, saying his ability to handle pressure 
is phenomenal. Arsheep wreaked havocon Pakistan’s top 
order on Sunday as he 
dismissed star batters 
Mohammad Rizwan, 
Babar Azam and 
Asif Ali at the iconic 
Melbourne Cricket 
Ground (MCG). The 
left-arm fast bowler, 
who is playing his first 
World Cup, finished 
with the figures of 3/32 
as Pakistan managed 
to post a competitive 
total of 159/8.
“If we follow him 
(Arshdeep) for the 
last couple of years, 
looking at the way he’s 
performed I think the 
one thing that stands 
out with that kid is 
his ability to build 
pressure. He did hard 
work in IPL and he is 
doing hard work in 
different phases he 
bowls (for India) i.e. 
the first powerplay 
and then death overs,” 
Mhambrey said in the 
pre-match press conference
“The composure he 
has shown, the clarity of thought process 
I think there will be 
ups and downs in his 
career but the way he 
has come back (after 
Asia Cup) the ability 
to handle pressure is 
phenomenal and I am 
not really surprised the 
way he has bowled in 
the first game (against 
Pakistan). We have 
a lot of confidence in 
him and he has a good 
future,” he added. 
Mhambrey praised 
the all-rounder Hardik 
Pandya, who played 
a crucial role in the 
match against Pakistan. India looked in 
no position to win the 
reduced to 31/4 while 
chasing a target of 
160 runs. But ‘Chasemaster’ Virat Kohli 
brought them back 
into the match with a 
brilliant stand of 113 
with Hardik Pandya, 
who played a crucial 
knock of 40 from 37 
deliveries as well. 
Indian bowling 
coach also confirmed 
that Hardik Pandya is 
fit and has no thoughts 
of resting him against 
the Netherlands. India will play the 
Netherlands next, with 
the match scheduled 
for October 27 at the 
iconic Sydney Cricket 
Ground.
“Hardik gives you 
that balance and option. He bowls you 
those four overs. Hardik wants to play all 
the matches. We are 
not thinking of resting him and no one is 
looking for rest. Hardik played a crucial 
knock. Virat finished 
the game but Hardik 
also played a crucial 
role. He gives you an 
option with both bat 
and ball. Pandya is 
fine and is available for 
the game against the 
Netherlands,” Mhambrey said.
The veteran bowler 
Ravichandran Ashwin showed his great 
presence of mind in 
the final over to guide 
India to a four-wicket 
win over Pakistan at 
the MCG.
When questioned 
about what conversation the management 
had before sending 
Ashwin, Mhambrey 
said: “It is other way 
around.”
“When it comes 
to Ashwin, it is him 
who tells us that this 
is what I am going to 
do. It is just the way 
he is. He showed his 
composure and the 
presence of mind to 
actually leave that 
ball. If you look at it, 
any other individual 
at that stage would 
just swing his bat but 
that is Ashwin for 
you,” Mhambrey said.

*
Team India will be looking to carry forward
he momentum gathered after a four-wicket win 
over Pakistan in a memorable 
match that marked the beginning of their campaign in the 
T20 World Cup being played 
in Australia.
Team India’s second encounter is with the 
Netherlands at Sydney Cricket 
Ground on Thursday. India 
are in the second position in 
Group 2 with two points with 
their win over Pakistan. The 
Netherlands have played one 
match and are yet to earn a 
point.
For the Indian top order, it 
will be an opportunity to let 
their arms loose as the next 
encounter is with South Africa. KL Rahul and Rohit 
Sharma will be looking forward to 
scoring big ahead of the South 
African challenge on October 
30. Virat Kohli, who was the 
star of the match against 
Pakistan at Melbourne, will look to 
continue with his good form. 
The match may again 
test middle-order batters 
Suryakumar Yadav, Dinesh 
Karthik and Hardik Pandya. 
The pace battery of Arshdeep Singh, Bhuvneshwar 
Kumar and Mohammad 
Shami delivered solid spells 
against Pakistan and bamboozled them in the powerplay. 
They will look to continue 
the form. Hardik Pandya lent 
able support to pacers with his 
three-wicket haul.
Though spinners Ravichandran Ashwin, Axar Patel did 
not make much impact in the 
first match, they can be lethal 
on their day. Yuzvendra Chahal, the side’s primary spin 
option, will look to get into his 
best form ahead of the match 
against Proteas. Team India 
will not be taking chances 
against the Netherlands 
which has played some good 
cricket against their opponents including Bangladesh, 
New Zealand and Pakistan 
this year.
Dutch opener Max O’Dowd 
is in great form. All-rounder 
Bas de Leede has performed 
consistently all year and has 
played a role in Netherlands’ 
qualification in the Super 12 
phase of the tournament. Colin Ackermann hit a valiant 
half-century against Bangladesh. Veterans Tom Cooper 
and Roelof van der Merwe offer a lot of experience that will 
prove handy against India. 
The Netherlands also have 
some solid bowlers like Logan 
van Beek, Paul van Meekeren 
and Fred Klaassen. On their 
day, Dutch bowlers can create 
trouble for any opposition. 
India scored a thrilling fourwicket win over Pakistan 
on Sunday at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. Virat 
Kohli shined with an unbeaten 82* off 53 balls and Hardik 
Pandya put up an all-round 
performance of 40 and 3/30. 
Arshdeep Singh took 3/32 in 
his first World Cup match, 
helping restrict Pakistan to 
159/8. The Netherlands, on the 
other hand, started its campaign with a narrow 9-run 
defeat to Bangladesh. 
Though a bowling spell from 
Paul van Meekeren (2/21) 
helped in restricting Bangladesh to 144/8 in 20 overs, the 
Asian country team bounced 
back to bundle out the Dutch 
for 135 with Colin Ackermann 
hitting a valiant 62.

Aman Sehrawat of Chhatrasal Stadium, Delhi achieved 
the distinction of becoming 
the World Champion of Un- 
der 23 in the Spanish city of 
Pontevedra recently. Till date 
no Indian wrestler has been 
able to achieve this feat at this 
level. After his return back to 
home, the entire Indian contingent received a grand 
welcome and Aman promised 
to repeat this performance 
in future major international 
competitions.
Aman has achieved this 
feat in 57 kg freestyle wrestling. In the same weight, 
Ravi Dahiya won a silver 
at the Tokyo Olympics last 
year. Aman also practices 
with Ravi Dahiya at Chhatrasal Stadium. He said that 
he was his senior and guided 
him very well. Whether 
he had the stamina to beat 
Ravi Dahiya, he said, “Look, 
this job is difficult but not 
impossible. If I work hard, I 
can do wonders and defeat 
him. I will leave no stone 
unturned from my side.” 
Aman proved himself by 
defeating wrestlers from Sri 
Lanka, Japan, Kyrgyzstan 
and Turkey in one-sided affairs in this event. He scored 
a total of 46 points in these 
four bouts, while conceded 
only 11 points. Aman told 
that among them Japanese 
wrestler Abe Toshiya was 
the World Junior Champion 
of 2019.  Before his bout, he 
hought it was going to be a 
very tough but he beat him 
1 3-2 .
Toshiya would fight in 
front of him in such a way 
that he did not even expect 
such an easy win. Aman said 
that in the final against Ahmet Duman of Turkey, who 
was a silver medallist of the 
Asian Under 23 championship, he had decided that he 
had to win the gold medal 
in any case. This mind-set 
proved to be decisive for him. 
Aman believes that if all his 
fellow wrestlers had got the 
visa, they could have even 
won the team championship 
because most of the wres- 
tlers in the team had won 
medals. He also expressed 
his gratitude to his coaches. 
He added, “The coaches only 
said that as I was doing, keep 
doing it. All will be well and I 
am glad that the same thing 
happened again and again.” 
Aman believed that at the 
national level, he had tough 
competitors in his weight 
category, which helped 
him in preparing for bigger 
competitions. It is true that 
many senior wrestlers had 
now moved to higher weight 
categories but in spite of that 
many talented wrestlers had 
entered in his weight to give 
tough competition. He said 
that when he gave even two 
to three points while win- 
ning gold in any competition, 
he would be disappointed as 
his aim was not to give so 
many points in the next competition.
It is worth mentioning 
here that Aman has been the 
champion of Under 15, Cadet 
and Under 23 categories at 
the Asian level. Apart from 
this, by becoming a World 
Cadet and now a champion 
in World Under 23, he has 
raised the flag of his talent. 
Similarly, he has proved his 
talent at the national level 
by winning gold in the National Championship and 
National Games. Aman said 
that Chhatrasal Stadium 
had played the biggest role 
in bringing him to this level. 
He said, “I came here only at 
the age of 10-11 years. I don’t 
have parents.  My uncle used 
to take care of me. My Kaka 
was a wrestler but not at the 
higher level. My uncle didn’t 
let me worry about the ex- 
penses. The truth is that I 
didn’t have the need to ask 
for anything separately from 
him.” Aman’s next target is 
to win a medal in the Asian 
Games and then a place in 
the Indian team for the Paris 
Olympics and then winning 
a medal is his biggest goal.

The Group 1, Super 12 
match of the ongoing ICC 
T20 World Cup 2022 between New Zealand and 
Afghanistan at Melbourne 
Cricket Ground (MCG) has 
been abandoned without a 
single ball being bowled. 
After this, New Zealand is 
at the top of the points table 
of Group 1 with three points 
and one win in two matches. On the other hand, Af- 
ghanistan finally has one 
point on the table. But they 
sit at the bottom of the table 
with no wins in two matches. Notably, the match 
between Ireland and England 
held earlier on Wednesday 
at the same ground was also 
affected by rain.
Rain played spoilsport in 
England’s already shaky 
chase, helping Ireland defeat the former champions 
by five runs as per Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) 
method in the Group 1, Su- 
per 12 match of the ICC T20 
World Cup at Melbourne 
Cricket Ground (MCG) on 
Wednesday. Put to bat first 
by England, Ireland was 
bundled out for 157 in 19.2 
overs. Skipper Balbirnie 
top-scored with a brilliant 
62 off 47 balls and had an 
82-run stand for the second 
wicket with wicketkeeperbatter Lorcan Tucker (34). 
Other than this partnership, England bowlers 
dominated the inning. Pacer Mark Wood took 3 
wickets for 34 runs in his four 
overs. Liam Livingstone 
also took three wickets for 
17 runs in his three overs. 
Sam Curran got two while 
Ben Stokes got one wicket. 
Chasing 158, England 
kept losing wickets at regular intervals, at one point 
reduced to 86/5. Knocks 
from Dawid Malan (35) and 
Moeen Ali (24*) offered the 
former champions some 
hope. However, with England five runs behind the 
DLS par score, rain interrupted the action and they 
lost the match by five runs.

After Pakistan’s loss to India 
at the MCG in a memorable 
match, Zimbabwe Captain 
Craig Ervine has said they are 
bracing for a fired-up Men in 
Green but noted that they can 
produce a major upset if the 
team adjusts well to the conditions and enormous 
dimensions of the Optus Stadium, 
especially square of the wicket. 
Zimbabwe will face Pakistan 
on Thursday in their second 
Super-12 encounter after 
it played a rain-curtailed 
match against South Africa, which was 
eventually washed off due to 
rain. “I’m pretty sure 
Pakistan will be coming 
hard for us. The first five-six overs with the new ball 
has been challenging for every team. It’s a key area to get 
through and capitalise with 
a lot of twos on offer in the 
middle overs with the bigger 
boundaries. We want to play 
exciting cricket,” the Zimbabwe captain said, according to 
ESPNcricinfo.
Craig Ervine believes Zimbabwe would want to counterat- 
tack Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf 
on the fast and bouncy Optus 
Stadium field after the match 
washout against South Africa. 
Zimbabwe have advanced 
from the first round to Super 12 
and the curtailed nine-overs-aside game could not be finished 
due to rain.
Following the game, there 
was significant discussion, and 
Zimbabwe coach Dave Houghton said “the game against 
South Africa was a little bit of 
a bizarre evening”.
“From a batting perspective, 
we were trying to work out 
how best to go about getting a 
decent score in nine overs. We 
knew we had to go fairly hard 
up front to get off to a good 
start,” he said.
Ervine said the weather looks 
 in T20 World Cups.
good for Thursday evening. 
“We can go back to our game 
plan knowing we have full 20 
overs to bat. Our batting innings will look more calm and 
composed,” he told reporters 
on Wednesday. Perth is predicted to have partially cloudy 
skies and Zimbabwe’s batters 
are expected to be under pressure from a strong Pakistani 
attack led by Rauf, who bowled 
fiercely against India. 
Zimbabwe are getting ready 
to take on Rauf and Pakistan 
bowlers with a positive attitude after adopting a more 
freewheeling stance with the 
appointment of Houghton as 
head coach in the middle of the 
year. “I don’t think you sit back 
and let quality bowlers like 
that bowl at you, otherwise it’s 
going to be a matter of time before they get you out. It will be a 
case of trying to make sure that 
you’re putting them under just 
as much pressure as they’re 
putting you under.”

Despite a seven-wicket defeat to Australia, Sri Lanka 
head coach Chris Silverwood 
remains optimistic that his 
team can make a semi-final 
push, even as their cursed 
injury run continued with 
quick Binura Fernando suffering a hamstring injury. 
A quickfire half-century 
by all-rounder Marcus Stoinis and his 69-run 
partnership with skipper Aaron 
Finch helped defending 
champions Australia to register a crucial seven-wicket 
win over Sri Lanka in their 
Group 1, Super 12 match of 
the ongoing ICC T20 World 
Cup at Perth on Tuesday. Sri 
Lanka succumbed to a fierce 
assault from Marcus Stoinis, 
who hit Australia’s fastest 
T20I half-century to finish 
with a match-winning 59 off 
18 balls.
“We knew Australia had 
to come hard at us because
of their net run rate. The 
way he [Stoinis] came back 
at us and struck the ball was 
exceptional,” ESPNcricinfo 
quoted Silverwood as saying. 
It leaves both teams with 
one win in Group 1, with Sri 
Lanka facing New Zealand 
at the SCG on Saturday in a 
must-win game.
“I truly believe that we 
can not only challenge this 
group, but come out victori- 
ous. I think we’ve shown we
have the capabilities and the 
skills within the group,” Silverwood said.
“I can’t fault the way the 
guys at the top of the order 
played. The ball did move 
around early on. Life was difficult for us. We’re not used 
to that sort of bounce that we 
get here in Perth. The way 
they went about their business to set that platform... 
they did very well,” said the 
Sri Lanka head coach.
