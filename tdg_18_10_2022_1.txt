The Gujarat government on 
Monday defended before the 
Supreme Court its decision 
to grant remission to the 11 
convicts in the Bilkis Bano 
Chief Minister and 
Aam Admi Party (AAP) 
leader Manish Sisodia on 
Delhi excise policy case. 
Emerging out of the grilling 
session, Sisodia claimed that 
CBI pressurised him to leave 
AAP. “The case is completely 
bogus, and I will not bow 
down to any pressure,” Said 
Sisodia.
Before heading to CBI 
Headquarters on Monday 
morning, the Deputy CM
was seen taking blessings 
from Mahatma Gandhi at 
Rajghat and also reached the 
agency office flanked by party workers. AAP leaders and 
workers also protested outside the CBI office to express 
support for Sisodia, with several people including AAP 
leaders Sanjay Singh, Rakhi 
Birla, and Kuldeep Kumar 
among others have been detained by the police. 
Sources said that the CBI 
was tough on Sisodia and 
asked as many as 50 questions pertaining to the excise 
case. However, at the end of 
the day Sisodia came out 
from the CBI office showing 
victory sign. 
Sisodia later claimed that 
CBI asked him to leave AAP 
saying that what is in Kejriwal’s part better you leave 
them. You would be finished 
if such things continue, 
claimed the Deputy CM. 
“CBI also told me that other 
parties may make you even 
CM, here in AAP you are 
not going to get that,” Sisodia 
claimed. “I replied that I am 
not in politics to be the CM, I 
am here to serve the nation, 
to work for education and 
poor.” 
Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra lashed out 
at the AAP over the rally. Patra called it as a “celebration 
of corruption”. “When Rahul Gandhi was summoned 
by ED, then also Congress 
started doing drama like this. 
It will not be an exaggeration 
to say that it is a celebration 
of corruption. First, they 
did corruption while giving 
liquor licenses in Delhi and 
now they are doing all this 
drama,” Patra said. 
“The way Manish Sisodia 
was raising slogans in an 
open car on the streets along 
with his supporters today, it 
seems as if Aam Aadmi Party has won the World Cup of 
corruption. Arvind Kejriwal 
was a part of Anna Hazare’s 
Andolan and used to say that 
he will finish corruption, but 
now it seems AAP has itself 
become the most corrupt 
party in the country,” Patra 
further said.
In August, the enforcement 
agencies conducted searches 
on Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s official 
residence among several other places in connection with 
the alleged corruption in the 
implementation of Delhi’s 
excise policy.
Sisodia, in charge of the 
excise department, has been 
under the scanner for alleged 
deliberate and gross procedural lapses which provided 
undue benefits to the tender 
process for liquor licensees 
for the year 2021-22. 
Sisodia is believed to have 
executed decisions in violation of the statutory provi- 
sions of the Excise Policy, 
which could have huge financial implications. Such 
“undue financial favours” 
to the liquor licensees after 
the deadline for awarding 
tenders caused huge losses 
to the exchequer, sources 
earlier claimed. 
The excise policy was 
passed in chief minister 
Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi 
Cabinet in the middle of 
the deadly 
Delta covid-19 
pandemic in 2021. 
Sisodia was 
among 15 others
booked in an FiR filed by 
the cbi in August including 
then Excise commissioner 
Arva Gopi Krishna, Deputy 
commissioner Anand Tiwari and Assistant 
commissioner Pankaj bhatnagar.

bJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, who is the Leader 
of the Opposition in bengal, took a swipe at the chief minister 
and said she should appoint Ganguly as brand ambassador 
of West bengal in place of actor Shah Rukh Khan. He said 
the Trinamool congress leader should not do politics in the 
matter. Mamata banerjee said here that Ganguly is popular 
and “not a political party member” and the centre need not 
to take a “political decision”. 
Mamata, on the other hand, said, “i request PM to make 
sure Sourav Ganguly must be allowed to contest icc 
election. He’s a popular figure which is why he is being deprived. 
Request Goi not to take a decision politically, but for cricket, 
sports...He is not a political party member.”  
“On behalf of all countrymen i say that Sourav Ganguly is 
our pride, he has skillfully managed his sports and 
administration career. He was bcci president. He was excluded in 
an unfair way; the compensation for it will be to send him to 
icc,” she said. 
The last date to file nominations for the international 
cricket council (icc) chairman elections is 20 October. 
Former indian cricketer Roger binny is set to take over as 
the next bcci chief.
Reacting to banerjee’s remarks, Suvendu Adhikari said if 
she wants to extend “Sourav Ganguly’s tenancy then, she 
should have made him the brand ambassador” of the state. 
Sourav Ganguly is slated to file his nomination for the

The high-profile Congress 
presidential elections on 
Monday witnessed high enthusiasm with 96% voting 
turnout, paving the way for 
electing a non-Gandhi party 
chief in more than 22 years. 
96% of voting have taken 
place across states and 
around 9,500 delegates have 
voted today. “No untoward 
incident occurred 3 ballot 
boxes have been received 87 
people voted at AICC, Delhi,” 
Congress Central Election 
Authority chairman Madhusudan Mistry has said. 
The results of the election 
will be declared on 19 October.
Both the contenders Mallikarjun Kharge and Sashi 
Tharoor expressed happiness over the poll process 
and said whatever would 
be the outcome the election 
would only strengthen the 
party. 
Congress president Sonia 
Gandhi cast her vote in the 
party’s polls to elect her successor. “I have been waiting 
for a long time,” Sonia Gandhi said when she was asked 
by mediapersons on the poll. 
Sonia Gandhi cast her vote at 
the headquarters of the All 
India Congress Committee 
(AICC). Congress general 
secretary Priyanka Gandhi 
Vadra also accompanied her 
mother Sonia Gandhi and 
cast her vote for the next 
president.
congress 
MPs P chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and other 
party leaders have also cast 
their votes at the Aicc office 
in Delhi.
Shashi Tharoor, who is 
pitted against party veteran 
Mallikarjun Kharge for the 
post of the congress president, said the revival of the 
grand old party has begun 
whatever the outcome and 
that the fate of the indian 
National congress lies in the 
hands of the party workers. 
“i am confident. The fate 
of the congress party is in
the hands of party workers. 
The odds have been stacked 
against us as the party leaders and establishment were 
overwhelmingly with the 
other candidate,” Tharoor 
told mediapersons at Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram.  
Kharge also said : “it is 
part of our internal election. 
Whatever we said to each 
other is on a friendly note. 
Together we have to build 
the party. (Shashi) Tharoor 
telephoned me and wished 
me luck and i also said the 
same.”
both Kharge and Tharoor 
campaigned ahead of the 
polls and congress will get 
a leader outside the NehruGandhi family as president 
after 24 years. The new 
party chief will have his 
task cut out with assembly 
elections having already 
been declared in Himachal 
Pradesh and poised to be 
held in Gujarat. 
The presidential election 
has taken place at the culmination of the party’s 
organisational elections and 
has come at a time congress 
faces multiple challenges.

said that accused Rahul 
Navlani used to disturb her 
and his wife used to believe 
that Vaishali was at fault for 
their breaking the marriage,

committing suicide. We did 
not have a one per cent clue 
that she would take such a 
drastic step all of a sudden,” 
Vaishali’s mother said adding that she had arrived in

she will get justice only after 
Rahul will be punished,” she 
said.
Assistant commissioner of 
Police (AcP) Moti ur Rehman earlier said that, “Rahul

Vaishali, because of which 
she took this extreme step. 
She was about to get married to another man and 
Rahul troubled her for that. 
The police are currently investigating the case.” 
“Rahul is currently not at 
his residence and has fled 
after locking his house. Police are currently locating 
Rahul, after that he will be 
questioned,” AcP Rehman

A seminar titled “Imam 
Khomeini: The Pivot of 
World Unity” was organised by the JK People’s 
Justice Front of Srinagar at the 
Syed Mehdi Auditorium, 
Kargil, which was attended 
by prominent personalities 
from Kargil and the Kashmir valley.
A variety of audiences 
took part in the programme 
from different backgrounds 
and beliefs. Also, several 
college and Higher Secondary School students 
also attended the seminar. 
While speaking at the event, 
Chairman of JK People’s 
Justice Front Aga Syed 
Abass Rizvi called India a 
“mother” and attacked Pakistan for targeted killings in 
the country.
In Pakistan, on the other 
hand, targeted killings of 
minorities, particularly 
Shia Muslims, are common. 
The Shia community forms 
only 20 per cent of the total 
Pakistani population. They 
are also followers of Islam, 
but still, the Shia community doesn’t hold the status 
of equality in the state of 
Pakistan,” he said.
Chief Coordinator JK 
People’s Justice Front Syed 
Mubashir Kazimi also criticised Pakistan for attacks 
on holy sites, saying, “There 
is no record of blasts in the 
holy places of minorities in 
India whereas it is common 
in Pakistan.”

Rajasthan Chief Minister 
Ashok Gehlot here on Monday said that his relations 
with the Gandhi family are 
“beyond any logic or contention”. He said it is just like 
Vinoba Bhave’s relations 
with Maa Geeta. Bhave once 
said that his relations with 
Geeta Maa were beyond any 
logic.  
Gehlot was at PCC head- 
quarters here to cast his vote 
for the presidential election. 
The CM was looking quite 
positive and confident as 
if everything was normal 
like before. Gehlot was talking to media persons here. 
He spent a lot of time at 
the headquarters, interacting with PCC chief Govind 
Singh Dotasra and other 
workers. 
He asked the workers to 
be in a battle-ready mode 
for the 2023 elections in 
Rajasthan. He appealed to 
the workers to ensure the 
party’s victory in the polls 
to strengthen the position 
of Rahul Gandhi. Moreover, 
the Bharat Jodo Yatra, which 
has given sleepless nights to 
BJP, will be a grand success 
when it passes through Rajasthan, Gehlot says.  
In a message to disgruntled 
leaders, Gehlot pointed out 
that what they wanted did 
not happen. However he advised them to have patience 
and to continue to work for 
the party. Gehlot’s message 
was for the leaders including Sachin Pilot who have 
either left the party or tried 
to quit it. Gehlot’s statement 
signalled that his relation 
with the Gandhis is normal 
like before. 
He also termed Congress 
presidential candidate Mallikarjuna Kharge as an 
experienced leader, saying that 
there can be no alternative to 
experience. Gehlot made his 
points about various issues 
like Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat 
Jodo Yatra, Gujarat polls, 
etc. like a responsible Congress leader.  
While responding to questions from media on the 
speculation about what will 
happen after 19 October, 
the day of party presidential results, Gehlot gave an 
example of Vinoba Bhave’s 
relation with Geeta Maa. He 
asked the media not to worry 
about his relations with the 
Gandhi family. “Even after 
19 October, his relations 
with the Gandhi family will 
remain like what they have 
been for the last 50 years,” he 
added signalling that Rajastan turmoil that happened 
few weeks ago, is over now.  
After his meeting with Rahul at Bellary, everything is 
apparently normal. After 
Gehlot’s activeness for the 
upcoming Gujarat polls, 
Congress workers are also 
quite enthusiastic and positive. He is the Congress observer for the Gujarat polls. 
The high command is expecting high performance 
from Gehlot. So, there will be 
no change now in Rajasthan.  
Replying to media queries, 
Gehlot took a dig at all his 
opponents including Sachin Pilot. To a question on 
disgruntled leaders, he said 
that those who have got 
election
some posts without struggle 
are “roaming around doing 
negative and destructive 
things”. When the “achche 
din” for Congress will return, these leaders will also 
get something good. If they 
show haste in achieving 
something, they will be faced 
with setbacks.  
Gehlot said those who left 
the party were opportunists. 
Some leaders left the party 
amid the crisis. These leaders got opportunity at a very 
young age, be it Scindia, Jitin 
Prasad and RPN Singh. He 
recalled his career as a young 
politician and said “I became 
deputy minister with Indira 
Gandhi”. But these leaders 
were made minister of state 
with good portfolios, he 
adds. The youngsters should 
have patience, he added. 
Working for the party adds 
to a leader’s stature gradually. 
Congress is witnessing two 
important developments at 
present. One is Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra and 
the other is the presidential 
poll. Both are important 
in their own ways.  Rahul’s 
Yatra has received a tremendous positive response 
across the country due to 
which political opponents 
are nervous. The feeling of 
fraternity and brotherhood 
is returning due to this yatra. 
The presidential poll is the 
symbol of internal party democracy. 
Gehlot says ever since coming to power, the BJP is 
throwing the constitution 
and legal system to the wind. 
There is hardly any respect 
for law by these people. People are being jailed without 
any reason, as the BJP leaders hate criticism which is a 
mandatory thing in democracy. Those in power are 
fascist. It is easy to instigate the 
public in the name of caste 
and religion, but it is difficult 
to douse the fire.  
Gehlot says that the results of 
Gujarat polls will be surprising. PM Modi is himself 
saying that Congress is working 
silently down to village level, 
he said. One can understand 
the meaning. Congress is 
quite strong in villages. Yes, 
its position is not that strong 
in the urban areas as was the 
case in the past. Congress is 
working towards strengthening its position in cities as 
well. The AAP is making a 
record in lying to people. 
Why the media is giving the 
AAP so much attention is 
beyond understanding. The 
coverage is not being given 
to Bharat Jodo Yatra of the 
Congress, the party which 
played an important role in 
the freedom struggle.  This 
is a big question mark on the 
media’s role and credibility. 
On Gujarat poll dates not being announced, Gehlot says 
ECI should explain why it 
only announced poll dates 
for Himachal Pradesh and 
excluded Gujarat, while the 
counting will be done together. This could not have 
happened without the intervention of PM Modi and 
Amit Shah, he alleged. How 
can the elections be impartial 
then? 
Gehlot said Mallikarjuna 
Kharge is quite an experienced leader. He will win 
by a huge margin. His experience will help Congress 
regain its past glory. Kharge 
has been in politics for 50 
years. He has been an MLA 
nine times and a Lok Sabha 
MP twice. He is the leader of 
Opposition in Rajya Sabha. 
He has solid organisational 
experience as well. The 
youth power can work hard 
but there is no alternative for 
experience. And Kharge’s 
vast political experience will 
benefit the party.

After  achieving  a 
milestone of  1,000 
kms of Bharath Jodo 
Yatra, Rahul Gandhi is all set 
to finish his Karnataka leg. 
The culmination of this leg 
was the hugely successful 
Bellari rally attended by all 
the biggies of the party including the two chief 
ministers Ashok Gehlot and Bhupesh 
Bhagel.
While Rahul will now 
head to Andhra Pradesh and 
Telangana before entering 
Maharashtra, the Karnataka 
leg was quite successful for 
the grand old party in terms of 
traction, eyeballs, and media 
attention. And one man will 
heave a sigh of relief KPCC 
president D.K. Shivakumar! 
An out of turn and an un- 
expected notice from the enforcement directorate in the 
middle of the yatra had unsettled him as he had rushed 
to Delhi for a couple of days, 
however, he accompanied 
Rahul for the larger part of 
the yatra.
The yatra which traversed 
through Mysore, Mandya, 
Tumkur, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Hospet, and then 
Bellari got the desired effect as 
lakhs of people joined the entourage. Sources in the 
Congress told The Daily Guardian 
Review that for Shivakuamar 
as Pradesh president it was a 
big challenge. “Being with Rahul and organizing a flawless 
yatra was a daunting task. We 
all know the kind of resources 
DKS can mobilize given his 
organizational skills and to 
carry out a contingent of thousands of people along 550 
kms was a different scale altogether. Every leader in each 
of the constituencies had to be 
taken into confidence. Pro- 
grammes en route, meeting 
people from different walks of 
life, organizing interactive sessions like the one with teachers, farmers, students, trad- 
ers, and skilled youth along 
with the daily exhaustion of 
walking 25 km will take a toll 
on anyone for that matter. 
DKS carefully planned and 
delegated the work in sync 
with the AICC which had to 
approve the plan. It’s a logistical nightmare,’’ he said. 
While this was the yatra 
part, the politics of it was an 
entirely different ball game. 
With elections just months 
away, the yatra had a lot of political significance too and the 
hottest topic all through was 
who led the race to get nominated as Congress’s nominee 
for the CM face and as expected it did surface 
when one of the journalists 
asked the question as to who 
the choice was. While Rahul 
played it safe saying there 
were many capable leaders 
in the party, his videos with 
former chief minister Siddaramaiah and D.K. 
Shivakumar were a testimony to the 
fact that these two were front 
runners. Another picture 
that went viral was that of 
Rahul Gandhi making these 
two leaders hold each other’s 
hands and walk in the yatra. 
The Bellari rally was a fit- 
ting finale for the Karnataka 
yatra of Rahul and one the 
highlights were D.K. Shivakuamar’s speech where 
he said: “This yatra is not 
to make Rahul Gandhi the 
prime minister, this yatra 
is not to make Maliikarjun 
Kharge the chief minister, this 
yatra is not to make Siddaramaiah the chief minister, this 
yatra is not to make D.K. Shivakumar the chief minister, 
but to unite the people of India who are getting polarized 
because of the BJP. By putting 
his name in the same space as 
Siddaramaiah and Kharge, 
DKS has upped his game and 
postured himself that he is no 
less a leader than these two.

The Supreme Court on 
Monday agreed to examine the plea of the 
National Commission For 
Protection of Child Rights 
(NCPCR) against Punjab 
and Haryana High Court 
order which stated a Muslim girl who is 16-years-old 
is competent to enter into a 
contract of marriage with a 
person of her choice under 
the Muslim Personal Law 
A bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaun 
said it will examine the issue and appointed senior 
advocate Rajshekhar Rao 
as amicus curiae to assist 
the court in the matter. 
The bench also issued notice to the Punjab 
government and others on the 
plea filed by NCPCR. 
“There is a question of 
law that requires to be considered,” the bench said 
while posting the matter 
for hearing on November 7.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for 
NCPCR contended that 
the Commission is not 
against the protection order granted to the girl but 
asked can the court pass 
orders against the penal 
provisions.
The High Court in June 
in its order had cited the 
provisions of the Muslim 
Personal Law on marriage 
for ruling that a 16-year-old 
Muslim girl was competent to enter into a 
contract of marriage with a 
person of her choice. 
The NCPCR sought to 
ensure the proper implementation of statutory 
laws that are specifically 
in place to protect children 
below the age of 18 years. 
The Commission highlighted the provisions of 
the Prohibition of Child 
Marriage Act (PCMA) 
2006 and the Protection 
of Children from Sexual 
Offences Act (POCSO) 
to put forth its reasons 
for challenging the High 
Court ruling.
NCPCR order is violative 
of PCMA which, the petition said, is a secular law 
that is applicable to all. 
It further said that the 
provisions of POCSO say 
no child under 18 years can 
give valid consent.
The High Court order had come on a plea 
by a Pathankot-based 
Muslim couple that had 
approached the court 
seeking protection after 
allegedly being threatened 
by their families for marrying without 
their permission.
The girl and a 21-year-old 
man had said that they 
got married as per Muslim 
rites and ceremonies. 
The High Court had 
granted protection to the 
Muslim couple noting 
that the law is clear that 
the Muslim Personal Law 
governs the marriage of a 
Muslim girl.

(ECI) announced on Friday. 
The term of the Himachal 
House will end on January 8, 2023. The legislative
assembly elections were 
last held on November 9, 
2017 in the region. In the

Congress MP Francisco 
Sardinha on Monday 
claimed that the Congress is 
the “only party” which can 
defeat the BJP and hence 
Rahul Gandhi should now 
stop the Bharat Jodo Yatra 
and go to Himachal Pradesh 
and Gujarat to campaign for 
the Assembly polls.
“I want Rahul Gandhi to 
stop the Bharat Jodo Yatra 
and go to Himachal Pradesh 
and Gujarat to awaken the 
public so that they vote for 
the only party that can defeat BJP. 
The only party that can 
be an opposition to BJP is 
Congress,” said Congress 
MP Francisco Sardinha after casting his vote for the 
next president of Congress. 
The Election Commission 
on Friday declared that Assembly polls will be held in 
Hima-chal Pradesh on November 12 and the counting 
of votes will take place on 
December 8.
The 182-seat Gujarat Assembly will go to polls later 
this year.
Sardinha, who is also a 
former Chief Minister of 
Goa, made this claim after
casting his vote and also alleged that there is no point 
in contesting when one 
knows that their defeat is 
“Shashi Tharoor is my 
colleague. If I had to meet 
I would have requested 
him for it because I knew 
everybody would be for 
Mallikarjun, so what is the 
point when you know that 
you are 100 per cent going to lose, you just want 
to show that you contested,” Sardinha said adding 
that he was sure of veteran 
leader Mallikarjun Kharge’s 
victory for the party’s president post.
“Nothing new, there have 
been elections earlier, unopposed, Madam Sonia ji was 
the president, Rahul ji was 
the president and now there 
are elections and I am sure 
Mal-likarjjun ji will be the 
new president of the Congress,” he said further. 
The 3,500-km yatra from 
Kanniyakumari to Kashmir 
is observing a “rest day” 
on the day of voting for the 
next president.
In the race for the next 
president of Congress, party leaders Shashi Tharoor 
and Mal-likarjun Kharge 
are in direct contest with 
each other.
Thiruvananthapuram MP 
Shashi Tharoor, who is pitted against party veteran 
Mal-likarjun Kharge for the 
post of the Congress presi- 
dent on Monday, said the revival of the party has begun 
whatever the outcome and 
confirmed.                                    
that the fate of the Congress 
lies in the hands of the party 
workers.
Tharoor said he was confident of winning the election 
but acknowledged the odds 
against him.
Meanwhile, Kharge also 
told ANI: “It is part of our 
internal election. Whatever we said to each other 
is on a friendly note. Together we have to build 
the party. (Shashi) Tharoor 
telephoned me and wished 
me luck and I also said the 
same.”
It is not the first time 
that a non-Gandhi leader 
is contesting for the party 
presidency post-Independence, as Jitendra Prasad 
contested for the post of the 
president about 22 years 
ago against Sonia Gandhi in 
which she emerged 
as a winner holding 
the mantle of the party for 
20 years.
Sonia Gandhi is the party’s longest-serving 
president, having held the office 
for over 20 years from 1998 
to 2017 and since 2019. 
This time no member of 
the Gandhi family is contesting for the post of President.
This is the sixth time in its 
nearly 137-year history that 
polls are being conducted to 
elect the national president 
of the party. In the 2017 
elections, Rahul Gandhi 
became the party president 
unopposed.

Adampur bypolls are 
around the corner. The 
Adampur assembly byelection was necessitated after 
Bhavya’s father Kuldeep 
Bishnoi quit the Congress 
and joined hands with the 
BJP. A tough battle is on the 
cards in the hot seat Adampur, as all parties namely the 
BJP, the Congress and the 
Aam Aadmi party are believed to be in a neck to neck 
fight. 
The Congress that has nominated Jai Parkash as the 
party candidate, continues 
to witness the widened rift 
among its senior leaders Bhupendra Singh Hudda, the 
Leader of Opposition and 
Kiran Chaudhary ahead of 
bypolls which added to the 
party high command as 
well as the party contestant. 
Amid the tall claims of winning the Adampur bypolls 
battle, the Congress does not 
seem united.  Kiran Chaudhary’s recent  comments 
clear indicate that all is not 
well in the party.She had taken Bhupender Singh Hooda,  
indirectly stating that the 
party is being run one sided 
leadership in the state that is 
most likely to harm the party 
forthcoming Adampur by 
elections. One person is taking all key decisions in the 
state unit of the party without consulting other senior 
leaders.  Further she said the 
Congress can win the Adampur bypoll if the party stands 
united otherwise it will have 
to face consequences. Thus, 
it is evident from the ongoing 
scenario that the party is a 
divided house in state which 
has forced the party high 
command to bring the widened feud among its leaders 
to an end.
Apart from aforesaid, two of 
party leaders Kumari Seleja 
and Randeep Surjewala are 
not in good terms with Hooda  
as Hooda factions have strongholds in the party . They also 
accuse him of taking one sided  
decisions. Everyone is familiar with the fact that most of 
the party legislators are firmly  
standing with him. In continuation to this , it is worth 
mentioning that rifts among the 
party leaders also led to delay in  
de-ciding the party contestant  
which brought criticism to the  
party. Contrary to this, the ruling faction BJP and AAP had  
decided their contestants before  
the Congress. Pertaining to this ,  
the other parties took a dig at the  
Congress saying that the Congress is a divided house which  
resulted in delay in deciding the  
candidate.   
Although, the party leaders refuse such allegations of 
infighting among them  Even some of  
the party leaders are of the view  
that the party continues to own  
a casual approach towards the  
Adampur by elections.

In Himachal, both the BJP and the 
Congress are in the process of decid- 
ing the election candidates. Election 
nominations are starting from tomorrow and both the national parties 
have not been ready the final candidate list yet. At the same time, 
congress is facing the voices of rebellion. 
People of Himachal sniff the in-house 
problem of the Himachal Congress 
on Social media.
BJP and Congress want to win 
the election at any cost, but mutual 
schism will be-come a big hindrance. 
Congress who is already struggling 
desperately for Himachal to come to 
power, but the rebellions are making 
Himachal Congress’s path full of 
hindrances. Former Congress MLA 
Subhash Mangalet from the Chaupal 
area of Shimla district made a direct threat to State In-charge Rajeev 
Shukla on social media. 
Congress has almost finalised the 
ticket of party general secretary Rajneesh Kimta from Shimla’s Chaupal 
assembly seat, but former MLA Subhash Mangalet has been opposing. 
Congress in-charge Rajeev Shukla 
himself took over the command for 
Kimta and despite a lot of opposition, his name was also decided. Still, 
Subhash Mangalet is furious and he 
has also vented fierce anger on social 
media.  Subhash Mangalet directly 
of the party in the state is divided into 
two factions.
Congress made a big change in 
the organizational setup in April 
2022 this year by making Pratibha 
Singh, wife of former Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh, and Lok Sa- 
bha MP from Mandi, the President 
of the State Congress Committee. 
Senior leader Sukhwinder Singh 
Sukhu has been appointed as the 
chairman of the election campaign 
committee. Kuldeep Singh Rathod, 
MP Pratibha Singh, senior leaders 
Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu, Asha 
Kumari, Ramlal Thakur and Mukesh Agnihotri have their own 
factions. In such a situation, even if the 
election is won, the mutual split will 
put it on the verge of distrust from 
targeted Rajeev Shukla on his social 
media account. He has written on his 
social media account not to worry. I 
am coming to contest elections. I am 
bringing the ticket of the people of 
Chaupal. I am going to the assembly 
in 2022. Satyameva Jayate. He has 
written that “Congress-BJP people 
are not hated, Rajiv Shukla Teri 
Khair Nahi.” Subhash Mangalet has 
been MLA from Chaupal seat for two 
times, he was also made the chairman of the State Marketing Board in 
the government of Virbhadra Singh.
Congress has played 10 guarantees 
to win the Himachal elections, but 
taking these guarantees to the public 
is a challenge for Congress, as there 
is division and fac-tionalism in the 
party organization. The leadership 
the very beginning. In the Himachal 
by-elections held last year, the Congress defeated the ruling BJP 4-0. 
Due to this, the spirits of Congress 
leaders and workers are high, but 
due to the crushing defeat in 5 states, 
the morale of the Congressmen has 
also been dropped. In such a situation, Congress needs a popular face, 
who can take all the leaders along 
and can also garner public support. 
In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, 
BJP won this seat by a margin of over 
4 lakh votes. Virbhadra Singh’s wife 
Pratibha Singh was elected MP from 
here in the by-election last year. The 
ruling BJP had to face the loss in the 
home district of Chief Minister Jai 
Ram Thakur, but this face is now 
sorely missed.

he Bharatiya Janata 
Party (BJP) on Monday withdrew its 
candidate from the Andheri 
East by-election.
The move was made in support of the Uddhav 
Thackeray faction’s candidate Rutuja 
Latke, as it withdrew its candidate Murji Patel from the 
seat. The announcement was 
made by Chandrashekhar 
Bawankule, the BJP Maharashtra President, in Nagpur. 
The Andheri East bye-election is slated to take place on 
November 3, this year. 
Addressing mediapersons 
here, he said, “The BJP coalition has decided to not 
contest Mumbai’s Andheri East 
Latke, the candidate from 
Uddhav’s Shiv Sena faction, 
to win the elections.
“We are taking back our 
candidate as we want Latke Ji 
to win the elections. The BJP 
will be contesting the seat in 
the 2024 elections,” he said.
Rutuja Latke
assembly by-election and our 
candidate Murji Patel will 
withdraw the nomination. 
It is a collective decision by 
both the central and the state 
leadership.”
The BJP leader further said 
that the party wants Rutuja 
“We were certain of our 
victory, but the BJP has 
been doing this in the state 
for a long time, and this is 
an example for people that 
even though we were winning, we’ve taken back our 
nomination,” he added. 
Rutuja Latke, the widow of 
the late Ramesh Latke, was 
pitted against the Shiv Sena 
camp led by Thackrey for the 
Andheri East bye-elections 
after the Bombay High Court 
on Thursday asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal 
Corporation (BMC) to accept the 
resignation of Rutuja Latke. 
Moreover, when Rutuja 
Latke was asked about reports of contact with the 
Shinde faction, she said, 
“My husband was loyal to 
Uddhav Ji and our family 
is loyal to him only. If I ever 
contest election, then it will 
be for the symbol of “Marshal” only.”
Earlier, Maharashtra Navirman Sena (MNS) 
president Raj Thackeray also 
requested Deputy Chief 
Minister Devendra Fadnavis 
not to field a BJP candidate 
against Rutuja Latke in the 
upcoming Andheri East Assembly by-polls in respect to 
the late MLA Ramesh Latke. 
In a letter to Fadnavis, the 
MNS chief said, “I am writing this letter with a special 
request. After the sudden 
death of MLA. Ramesh 
Latke, for Andheri East, the 
by-poll election has been announced. His widow, Rujuta 
Latke, has filed in for candidature for the same.”

Ghulam Nabi Azad, Democratic Azad Party 
chairperson, on Sunday reiterated the 
demand for the restoration 
of statehood ahead of the assembly elections scheduled 
next year.
Former Congress Rajya 
Sabha MP and Democratic 
Azad Party chairperson Ghulam Nabi Azad addressed 
a public rally in Kathua and 
launched three main agendas 
of his outfit. “We have three 
main agendas, first to restore 
statehood, second to reserve 
the rights of purchasing lands 
for J&K people only, and third 
to reserve job rights only for 
local youth”, Azad said in a 
public rally. Adding that we 
will not step back until these 
agendas are fulfilled. Former 
Jammu and Kashmir Chief 
Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad 
on Monday announced that 
his new political outfit will 
be named the ‘Democratic 
Azad Party’. The development comes exactly a month 
after Azad resigned from the 
Congress party.
At a press conference here 
to announce the name of the 
new party, Azad stated that 
it will be secular, democratic, 
and independent of any influence.
Azad also unveiled the flag 
of the Democratic Azad Party. 
The flag has three colours mustard, white, and blue. 
Earlier, Azad, in his first 
public meeting in Jammu 
after quitting Congress, announced the launch of his 
own political outfit that will 
focus on the restoration of full 
statehood.
Ghulam Nabi Azad resigned 
from Congress on August 26 
after serving for 52 years. 
In his resignation letter to 
Sonia Gandhi, he targeted the 
party leadership, particularly 
Rahul Gandhi, over the way 
the party has been run in the 
past nearly nine years. 
Azad claimed in the five 
page letter that the party is 
run by a coterie, with Sonia 
Gandhi serving as “a nominal head” and all major 
decisions being made by “Rahul 
Gandhi or rather his security 
guards and PAs.”
He was earlier the Leader of 
Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. Recounting his long as- 
sociation with the Congress, 
Azad had said the situation in 
the party had reached a point 
of “no return.” While Azad 
took potshots at Sonia Gandhi in the letter, his sharpest 
attack was on Rahul Gandhi, 
and he described the Wayand 
MP as a “non-serious individual” and “immature”.

O Pannerselvam (OPS) 
chastised rival faction leader 
Edappadi Palalniswai (EPS) 
on Monday for failing to attend an assembly session that 
began on Monday.
The former Chief Minister, 
OPS, was seen participating in the proceedings of the 
House while seated in the 
chair of the AIADMK deputy 
floor leader. EPS was absent 
from the assembly session. 
As per sources, he “boycotted” the Assembly session 
because rival faction leader 
OPP was made to sit as the 
Assembly Deputy Opposition Leader Chair, the sources 
said.
Addressing mediapersons after the session, OPS 
said, “We are attending the 
assembly session today as 
AIADMK MLAs. You should 
ask the EPS faction why they
did not attend the assembly 
session.”
On being asked about the 
existing feud in the party, 
OPS said that it is a dangerous situation that the 
bylaws of the party are being 
changed.
“MGR created this party for 
the cadres and subsequently 
Amma lead the party. She executed a lot of social welfare 
schemes. She protected the 
bylaws created by MGR. Even 
after 100 years, the bylaws 
will be protected no matter 
what,” he said.
“People of Tamil Nadu are 
supporting us. MGR said that 
the cadres are the roots of the 
party. It is a dangerous situation that the party bylaws 
are being changed. This 
will cause pain to the soul of 
MGR,” he further said. 
Earlier today, the Tamil 
Nadu Assembly passed a 
condolence resolution for the 
death of UK Queen Elizabeth, 
a former MLA and prominent politician who passed 
away recently.
The assembly was post- 
poned by Assembly Speaker 
M. Appavu after the condolence resolution was passed. 
Earlier on July 11, in the 
General Council meeting 
convened, EPS was elected 
as the interim General Secretary of the party. Before the 
meeting, supporters of both 
rival factions clashed outside 
the party headquarters. Following the violent clash, the 
headquarters were seized 
by the Revenue Divisional 
Officer.
The August 17 judgement 
by a single bench of Justice G 
Jayachandran had nullified 
the July 11 meeting and ordered the status quo, as prior 
to July 11. The EPS camp then 
challenged the single bench 
judgement to a division bench 
of the Madras High Court, 
which ruled in favour of EPS

National Conference leader 
Farooq Abdullah on Monday alleged that incidents of 
targeted killings by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir 
are not going to stop “until 
justice is served.”
“This will never stop until justice is served. Earlier 
they said such killings were 
happening due to Article 
370, but it’s abrogated now, 
so why haven’t such killings 
stopped? Who’s responsible?” the National 
Conference’s Farooq Abdullah 
said. Meanwhile, an allparty meeting is being held 
at the residence of Abdullah 
in Jammu on the electoral 
roll revision, ahead of the 
assembly elections likely to 
be held next year. 
Earlier on Saturday, 
Puran Krishan Bhat, a 
Kashmiri Pandit, succumbed to his injuries after 
militants opened fire at him 
while he was on his way to 
an orchard in Shopian. 
Bhat was rushed to the 
hospital where he was declared dead.
Ravinder Raina, chief of 
the Bharatiya Janata Party 
(BJP) in Jammu and Kashmir, condemned the killing 
of a Kashmiri Pandit by terrorists and said the 
perpetrators would be turned to 
dust.
The Jammu and Kashmir 
BJP chief Ravinder Raina 
told the press, “All the conspiracies of Pakistan and 
terrorists will be made unsuccessful. Those who 
conspired to target a Kashmiri 
Pandit will have to bear the 
brunt. The army and police 
have put up check nakas, 
and the conspiring terrorists will be turned to dust.” 
According to Jammu 
and Kashmir Police, the 
terrorist group Kashmir 
Freedom Fighters claimed 
responsibility for the death 
of a Kashmiri Pandit in the 
Shopian district.
Deputy Inspector General 
(DIG) Sujit Kumar said, “A 
Kashmiri Pandit, Puran Ji 
has been murdered. We are 
working on the case. KFF 
(Kashmir-freedom-fighters) 
has claimed responsibil- 
ity for it. We won’t say anything for sure about it, yet. 
A guard was present here.” 
As per the eyewitnesses, 
only one person had targeted him and was in front 
of him.
“In the initial investigation, eyewitnesses say that 
there was only one person 
who had targetted him and 
was in front of him. Nobody 
has spotted anyone else who 
might be hiding. Things will 
be clear, give us some time,” 
said Kumar.
DIG Kumar further said, 
“We are ascertaining the 
reason. He had gone out 
on his scooter and had returned on it. He wasn’t 
alone, they were two people. 
If the incident occurred in 
the presence of the guard 
who was deployed here, action will cover not only him 
but all concerned officers in 
the area.”

A love jihad case surfaced 
in Madhya Pradesh after 
police on Sunday registered 
a case against a person who 
disguised himself as a Hindu 
and allegedly raped a woman. 
Mohammad Akram, impersonating his identity as 
Amar Kushwaha, allegedly 
raped the woman after developing friendship with 
her. “The complainant girl 
told us that she had been 
talking to a young man on call 
for a month, who introduced 
himself as Amar Kushwaha, 
who took her to the hotel today and raped her,” Madhya 
Pradesh Nagar Police Station 
In-charge Sudhir Arjariya 
said. “Later he revealed himself as Mohammad Akram 
and also pressurised her to 
change religion for marriage”, 
he added.
While describing the case, 
prima facie of love jihad, 
Sudhir Arjariya told ANI 
that on the basis of the complaint of the victim, the police 
have lodged a case under the 
Madhya Pradesh Freedom of 
Religion Act 2020 and different sections of the IPC against 
the accused.
After the matter came to 
the fore, extremist outfits expressed their outrage. 
The activists of the Sanskriti Bachao 
Manch reached the police 
station and demanded the 
strictest action in the matter. 
“The incidents of love jihad 
should be stopped”, Sanskriti 
Bachao Manch told the press. 
Adding that we will not tolerate ‘Love Jihad’.
Earlier, in February 2021, a 
Muslim youth was arrested 
in Indore, Madhya Pradesh 
under relevant sections of 
the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Ordinance, 
2020—commonly called 
the ‘love-jihad’ law, which 
prohibits and provides for 
punishment for conversion 
by “misrepresentation, undue 
influence, coercion, marriage 
or any fraudulent means”. 
Notably, in the former case, 
an FIR has been registered on 
the basis of a complaint and 
a police investigation is underway to nab Mohammad 
Akram.

*
was summoned by the 
teacher of my son in 
Class XII at Modern 
school as it had confiscated 
the mobile phone that he had 
carried to school. I sat at the 
waiting room for close to two 
hours (the teacher was actually busy at a meeting with 
other teachers) and made to 
sign an undertaking saying 
that my son would not carry 
mobile to school and, if was 
found with one, the instrument would be confiscated 
and not returned.
As a liberal parent, I did 
not find an issue with him 
carrying a mobile since at 
many times it comes as a 
rescue when we have to 
pass on messages to him or 
make an urgent call. I could 
have made arguments but 
I realised that I must abide 
by the school discipline. 
Mobiles actually lead to distractions in classrooms. Also 
when we join some institutions, we agree to abide by 
the rules and regulations. 
This was the simple logic. 
Without getting into the 
merits of the decision taken 
by Justice Hemant Gupta 
and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia, and the arguments on 
which they based their decisions, I want to approach the 
issue as a common man who 
tries to make sense of the entire controversy. Both Justice 
Gupta and Dhulia have given 
compelling arguments representing the two sides of a 
coin and the Supreme Court 
of India is well equipped to 
take a final call on this. The 
entire country would await 
that since it would decide 
which way the country 
would move.
School uniform is an integral part of school 
discipline. Why teachers scold 
you when you wear dirty 
shoes or unkempt hair or unwashed clothes? It is not our 
scolding but the fear of the 
school teacher that has often 
forced my son to go to the 
barbers and have a decent 
hair-cut. School is the place 
where we develop bonhomie 
with other students, learn 
discipline and receive the 
message of oneness of being 
an Indian first.
What happens if we all interact by wearing our badges 
of differences? Our separate 
identities would prevail over 
oneness- the least common 
factor. We would learn to 
tolerate the issues that divide 
but not appreciate the issues 
that unite. Assertion of such 
individual identities would 
create problems of assimilation and provide opportunities for conflict. When these 
students come out of their 
classes, the divide would get 
further accentuated since 
those flashes of brilliance 
that called for bonhomie 
would be missing. A Muslim 
would be a Muslim first and 
a Hindu would be a Hindu 
first. The search for national 
identity would get lost in factors of conflict.
But this is exactly what 
Islamists want. The PFI 
and its student wing the 
Campus Front of India have 
been working hard to train 
its cadre that would demonstrate on issues considered 
Islamic and that would intend to polarise the commu- 
nity. The theory of Hindus 
and Muslins being two nations got compromised due 
to the process of secularisation. It is reasserting at a time 
when waves of liberalism is 
blowing across the country. 
Muslims should not look like 
Hindus (they come from the 
same cultural stock) and 
they should not have Hindu 
cultural practices (Muslim 
women in places like Bihar 
wear vermillion on their 
forehead and wear saris) 
and for these two to happen 
the identity issues must be 
reinforced. Muslims in danger or Islam in danger makes 
a deadly narrative to polarise even the liberal section 
among Muslims. 
Nonetheless, the controversy itself is interesting and 
sounds ironical when juxtaposed against the massive 
protest happening in Iran 
on the rights of women not 
to wear hijab and the entire 
world coming in support of 
this. And Iran is an Islamic 
country.
India is sitting on a cusp of 
identity explosion if the issue 
is not handled in a sensitive 
way. There is likely to be a 
massive reaction or ideological backlash from the other 
side if the hijab controversy 
is not understood in the right 
context. It is ironical to find 
scores of legal luminaries, 
who claim themselves to be 
liberal, fighting for the hijab. It is satisfying to watch 
Muslim panellists on Indian 
television news channels de- 
bating pro and against hijab 
in educational institutions. 
This means that there is division within the community 
on this and none can claim 
monopoly.
What happens if tomorrow Hindus start asserting 
their identity symbols in 
such educational institutions? It would be amusing 
to find out saffron clad students dotting tilak on their 
foreheads or other symbols 
while coming to schools. 
Every state has its own cultural dress. What happens 
if students start wearing 
their state’s cultural attires? 
School would become a 
place for fancy dress competition and none can be 
stopped since they would 
be exercising their choices 
as per the constitution. Why 
bother to wear school uniform then?
And when it comes to 
choices, we would look hypocrite if we do not question 
why an adult who can elect 
a Government at the age of 
18 years by exercising his 
vote, cannot drink alcohol at 
the same age? Why should 
Indian states have different 
age for allowing adults to 
drink? It is 18 years in Goa, 
Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Sikkim and Puduch- 
erry where as in many other 
States including Delhi it is 21 
years. And there was no reason why till recently males 
and females in our country 
had different legal ages for 
marriage in an era where 
we talk of equality (the Modi 
Government raised the age 
of marriage recently to bring 
it at par with male). 
Accepting the pro-hijab argument would mean a death 
knell to liberty of millions of 
Muslim women who feel the 
fresh wave of liberal air by 
not covering their faces and 
face the world boldly without revealing their religious 
identity. What is more secular? Interacting after 
asserting an intense religious identity? Or, interacting without 
using religious symbols? 
Tomorrow these girls or 
women would be asked to 
follow the example of those 
wearing hijab. This would be 
nothing but reinforcement 
of fundamentalism by the 
liberal society. One question 
that many people are asking is why has controversy 
surfaced now. Millions of 
girl students from rural areas attend schools and 
colleges and without facing 
any difficulty. People in the 
villages and the social fabric 
guarantee their safety. Some 
undesirable incidents may 
happen but these are far few 
in comparison to those that 
happen in so called civilised 
societies. And there is no 
statistics to prove that after 
wearing hijab or burqa, a girl 
becomes more safe. If hijab is 
the solution to women safety, the State can save a lot by 
making it mandatory for all. 
And there is no statistics to 
prove that only Muslim girls 
are unsafe and have to work 
at home and hence they be 
allowed to wear hijab. 
But this would also be an 
admission on the part of 
the State that is has failed 
to provide safety and security to its citizens. The 
challenges to law and order due 
to breakdown of societal 
values cannot be compensated through hijab. If gaze 
of men is the issue, these 
men found to be guilty of 
giving such gaze should be 
compulsorily asked to wear 
hijab. Why should women 
suffer for fault of men? 
Imagine what would happen if teachers in schools or 
colleges are looking at these 
hijab wearing women to find 
out if they have understood 
a concept or not. Facial expression is important in 
such education. The simple 
logic is if you can look at my 
face I should be able to look 
at your face. Otherwise a hijab wearing teacher should 
teach and it would be really 
funny to find out a such a 
teacher teaching hijab wearing girls.
Modern technology has 
come as a rescue to resolve 
this dilemma. Why go to 
school at all? Have a Class 
where teaching is done by 
computer: male voice for 
male student and female 
voice for female students. 
Why create problems for 
others when you can have 
the best of education at 
home?
No social, cultural or such 
spurious arguments should 
vitiate the atmosphere at 
schools and colleges. We 
will need to think of such extremities to find a solution to 
such a controversy. Regressive thoughts must give ways 
to liberal and progressive 
ways of life. And the only 
maxim that guides us all is 
You always Have a Choice.

China’s Communist Party started its 20th 
National Congress in Beijing by showcasing Xi Jinping’s 
achievements in the last five years. A film screened 
at the inauguration showed the 2020 Galwan valley 
clash, which killed 20 Indian soldiers, as one of Xi’s 
achievements. The inauguration was also attended 
by Qi Fabao, a PLA officer who was injured in the 
clash and whose presence at the Winter Olympics 
torch rally resulted in India not participating in the 
Games held in Beijing earlier this year. Thus, a clear 
message was sent to India that China would 
continue to highlight the Galwan clash as an achievement 
against the enemy—India—to boost the morale of 
its soldiers. This is in keeping with Xi Jinping’s 
earlier speeches to the PLA, where he spoke of enemies 
at the border would be taught a lesson. Xi may not 
have spoken of India in his two-hour-long speech 
on Sunday, but the underlying message was there 
for all to comprehend, and should serve as a 
wakeup call for those in India who believe that it’s 
Taiwan that is at immediate risk of being invaded by its 
predatory neighbour, and not India. The fact is, the 
US is behind Taiwan, and China may not be 
looking forward to a clash with the American forces, 
apart from the fact that any action against Taiwan 
may invite US sanctions. In such a situation, India 
becomes the obvious target. The worry is that India 
may have to pay a high price for its so-called 
neutrality, which appears to be more Russia friendly 
than being actually neutral. India will not only 
have to fight its own war but also may not get any 
help from the US in terms of imposing sanctions 
on China when a conflict takes place. No wonder 
China wants to ensure that India-US relations do 
not achieve the great heights these can if they join 
hands as the world’s two most influential 
democracies. This should also explain the whole 
ecosystem that has grown in the West where the Chinese 
communists have joined hands with the Islamists 
in spinning a narrative of fascism in India, trying 
to paint this country as a rights violator, which is 
committing a genocide of its minority population. 
An aside: this attempt became blatantly obvious 
during Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s 
recent visit to the US, when a full-page 
advertisement was taken out by unknown organisations in 
the most prestigious business newspaper there, 
asking investors not to invest in India and urging 
the US government to put the Indian minister and 
10 others under the Global Magnitsky Act, which 
sanctions foreign government officials for human 
rights abuse.
The fundamental problem of India-China 
relations is that the latter is convinced that the former 
will have to be shown its place, kept in turmoil to 
manage the neighbourhood and to establish its own 
hegemony in Asia. As experts say, the 1962 war was 
not so much about the border dispute between the 
two countries, but about showing India, rather, 
Jawaharlal Nehru, “a world figure”, his place. In 
the 21st century, China has a problem with India’s 
rise and the border dispute becomes an excuse to 
try and cut India down to size, one of the reasons 
it keeps the issue alive till date. But sooner or later 
there is bound to be conflict when China 
overreaches—and China will overreach, while crying victim. 
Ironically, just like the Chinese, the Indian foreign 
policy and security establishment too knows that 
a conflict is inevitable it is a question of when and 
not if. Or at least many of them do. It is just that 
the Chinese want to lull them into complacency 
by saying that it is possible to normalize relations 
by keeping the border issue on the back burner. 
That is why India’s current stand that without the 
resolution of the border issue there cannot be any 
movement forward towards the normalization of 
relations is causing so much unhappiness in China. 
But how can there be normalization when China’s 
infrastructure building along the LAC picks up 
pace, proving that its intentions are wrong? 
There is no doubt that India is doing a far better 
job than the West in standing up to China. Half the 
countries in the West are still struggling to get rid 
of TikTok and Huawei, or not even trying, as in the 
case of TikTok in the US. India has got rid of both 
and is trying to reduce its dependency on Chinese 
telecom products. But we still have a long way to 
go before we can decouple from China. Amid this 
it is important to call out China internationally 
for what it is—a totalitarian state and a genocidal 
power. Hence, India’s abstention from voting at the 
UN human rights council on China committing 
genocide of the Uyghurs was so disappointing. As 
the largest democracy of the world, India needs to 
make exception to its rule of not taking any stand 
against any country at the UN.
As for the party congress, it once again reminded 
us that India-China relations are anything but 
normal. India has to stay vigilant, for a lot will depend 
on how badly hamstrung Xi gets because of the 
economic turmoil in China. He just might feel the 
need to launch a military offensive in the hope of a 
quick victory to justify his continuance in power. 
China’s 20th party congress is a portent of 
dangerous times to come.

It is a stage that Mamata 
Banerjee thrives on: a huge 
spectacle, masses of people, 
song and dance, lights and 
colour in a unique combination that only the Durga 
pujas can bring to the City 
of Joy. And its grand finale 
is the Carnival which is organised each year in the city 
since 2016. This year’s carnival was special in more ways 
than one. It was the first after 
the Covid-induced hiatus of 
the last two years. It was also 
the first Carnival after Bengal’s biggest celebration got a 
heritage tag from the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) which recognized 
“Durga Puja in Kolkata” and 
put it on the “Representative 
List of the Intangible Cultural 
Heritage of Humanity”. To 
commemorate the UNESCO’s 
recognition, the West Bengal 
Government drew up plans to 
hold mini-carnivals in each 
district headquarter in the 
State. Another subliminal 
message that it sought to 
send out was this was the 
first Carnival after the Trinamool Congress vanquished 
its challenger, the BJP, in the 
2021 Assembly elections. That 
was an election during which 
the BJP’s big guns famously 
declared during campaigning 
that the “Mamata government 
did not allow Durga Pujas to 
be organised in the state”. It 
was seen as a fitting reply to 
such detractors. 
Trinamool Congress supporters could not be faulted 
if they saw their electoral victory in terms of “Mahishasura 
Mardhini” which literally 
means one who killed the 
Asura Mahishasura and refers to Goddess Durga.  And 
no prize for guessing who this 
Durga that they worship was. 
It was a stage tailor-made for 
Mamata Banerjee to send out 
some very well-targeted messages. The main aim was to 
send out an “all is well” message to her party workers at 
a time when conversations 
at tea stalls, buses and trains 
across the state all revolve 
SudeSh Verma
around the multiple scams 
that have been unearthed. 
Mamata’s self-styled second in-command in the party and 
cabinet Partha Chattopadhyay is in jail for the past two 
months for his alleged role 
in selling teaching and nonteaching jobs that his 
education department was in charge 
of filling up. His many accomplices, including a starlet, 
are in custody and images of 
hillocks of cash and jewellery 
recovered from the starlet’s 
apartments are being seen as 
proceeds of crime the likes of 
which the state or perhaps the 
nation has never seen earlier. 
The exuberance that the 
Carnival sought to portray 
was all around: the Kolkata 
Police’s bike squad performed 
stunts dressed as Durga and 
her children. Ninety-five of 
the city’s best Puja idols rolled 
down Red Road on decorated trailers accompanied by 
their organising committee 
members dressed up in traditional designer-wear and 
amid specially curated song 
and dance numbers. The only 
one missing from all the action was the one which was 
famously identified with Partha Chattopadhyay and like 
him, was consciously consuprotim mukherjee
the daily guardian review tuesday 18 october 2022
new delhisigned to oblivion this year by the organisers.
As the floats carrying the 
idols passed by, performers 
did their routines in front of 
a stage done up to resemble a 
jamindar’s mansion. The focus, by design, was squarely 
on Mamata. Mamata tried to 
play her part conscientiously. 
She joined a group of Santhal dancers as a tribal song 
played. She played the Dhak, 
the drum whose sound heralds the autumn festival and 
also swung dandiya sticks 
with gusto.
But veteran Mamata and 
TMC watchers could see 
that her heart was not in it. 
She was going through the 
motions carefully, standing, 
applauding and smiling. But 
the smile was forced. The facial muscles twitched into a 
smile, but the eyes did not 
mirror the same. Her oldtime lieutenants Sudip 
Bandyopadhyay and Assembly 
Speaker Biman Banerjee’s 
glum expressions did noth- 
ing to dispel the widely-held 
impression that the Pujas 
was a mere stop-gap before 
the Central law enforcement 
agencies upped the ante on 
corruption in the state. 
The Education Department 
comment & analysis
scams unearthed by law enforcement agencies under 
the eagle-eyed scrutiny of 
the judiciary, the unbelievable accumulation of wealth 
by a Class-8 pass-out and fishseller who was the district 
president of the Trinamool, 
and rumours of many more 
scams waiting to be revealed 
are worries that bedevil Mamata. “Who next?” is a ques- 
tion that is increasingly gaining ground these days. 
The BJP, with its troika of 
State leaders, President Sukanta Majumdar, his 
predecessor Dilip Ghosh and new 
entrant from the Trinamool 
Suvendu Adhikari are doing 
all they can to declare that in 
a matter of a few months, 
most of Mamata’s Cabinet colleagues would be in jail. Even 
Mamata, who was carefully 
branded as “Satata-r prateek” 
(the epitome of honesty), will 
go to jail, assert BJP leaders. 
Reports of widespread corruption are not the only 
worries facing Mamata Banerjee. 
Her party, say observers, is 
now a divided house with 
factions that eye each other 
with suspicion. Her nephew 
and heir apparent Abhishek 
Banerjee is apparently trying 
to bring forth a “new and improved” Trinamool with his 
own band of chosen leaders, 
thereby implying that Mamata’s old associates are tainted 
and need to be discarded. Observers say this faction would 
be even happier than the BJP 
if more leaders loyal to Mamata are exposed as corrupt.

Thackeray in Maharashtra 
are being flogged by gleeful 
BJP leaders as being “imminent”. The big question is who 
can become the Trinamool’s 
Eknath Shinde.
The stagnating economy 
is another big worry for 
Mamata. The Centre has 
also put its brakes on giving 
funds to the state amid allegations of fund diversion. 
The judiciary, under whose 
dogged supervision layers of 
scams are being unravelled 
every day, is leaving the Trinamool squirming. Judges are 
being seen as the saviours 
by thousands of deserving 
youth whose jobs were allegedly sold by the Trinamool 
leaders. Their stated resolve 
to punish wrong-doers is 
sending shivers down many 
spines.

he Supreme Court 
in the case Amarjeet Singh v. Union 
of India observed and has 
dismissed a petition seeking 
guidelines to prevent misuse of maintenance laws by 
means of conflicting orders 
and overlapping jurisdic- 
tions.
The bench comprising of 
Chief Justice UU Lalit and 
Justice Hemant Gupta observed and has remarked 
that the issue raised in the 
petition had already been 
dealt with by the Supreme 
Court.
It was observed that as 
per the petition, the amount 
for maintenance could be 
granted under various provisions of law including 
Section 125 of CrPC, Domestic Violence Act, Hindu 
Marriage Act etc. The same 
resulted in multi-pronged 
situation causing severe inconvenience to parties that 
were required to pay maintenance. Thus, the writ 
petition sought for all forms of 
maintenance to be granted 
under the same umbrella. 
It was stated by CJI that 
there had been a judgement 
by Justice Indu Malhotra 
in the case Rajnesh v Neha, 
wherein providing that if a 
woman has been granted 
maintenance under a specific provision of law and 
she would not be granted 
additional maintenance by 
any other forum.
supreMe Court
Therefore, the petitioner 
continued arguing saying that many persons ap- 
proached different forums 
seeking for maintenance despite there existing a single 
ground. It was submitted 
by him an exa,ple of a case, 
two different proceedings 
in two different courts had 
been going on, based on the 
same groundIt was stated by him if 
there is a case in two places 
on the same ground and 
two different judges pass 
two different orders, then 
it is being hundred percent 
sure that one of the two 
judges must have given a 
wrong decision, which is 
against justice and if both 
the judges pass the same 
order, then what is the point 
JharkhaNd high Court
of wasting the time on the 
same issue, of two different 
judges?.
However, CJI Lalit reiterated that the issue had 
already been dealt with in 
the case of Rajnesh v. Neha, 
wherein it provides guidelines to overcome the issue 
of overlapping jurisdiction, 
and avoid conflicting orders being passed in differ- 
ent proceedings and thus 
ensuring uniformity in the 
practice followed by the District Courts/Family Courts/ 
Magistrate Courts. 
The guidelines issued read 
as follows:
a) Where successive claims 
for maintenance under dif- 
ferent statutes are made by 
a party, the court would be 
considering an adjustment 
or set- off, of the amount 
awarded in the previous 
proceedings, while determining that whether any 
further amount is to be 
awarded in the subsequent 
proceeding.
b) For the applicant it may 
be made mandatory to dis- 
close the previous proceed- 
ing and the orders passed 
therein, in the subsequent 
proceeding;
c) In the previous 
proceedings, if the order 
passed requires any modification or variation, it would 
be required to be done in the 
same proceeding. 
Accordingly, the petition 
was dismissed by CJI Lalit 
while stating that “every 
facet had already been considere.

The Chhattisgarh High 
Court in the case Smt. Meena Sidar v State of 
Chhattisgarh & Ors observed and 
has denied compassionate 
employment to a deceased 
employee’s married daughter, wherein stating that she 
wo no more ‘dependant’ on 
her father’s income.
The bench comprising of 
Justice Narendra Kumar 
Vyas observed that the 
petitioner-daughter was 
married before the death of 
her father and it cannot be 
said that she was dependent 
upon his earning.
It was observed that the 
bench heavily relied on 
Supreme Court’s recent 
decision in the case State 
of Maharashtra & Anr. v. 
Madhuri Maruti Vidhate, 
wherein the court held that 
married daughter cannot 
be said to be dependent on 
her deceased mother and 
therefore, is not eligible for 
compassionate appointment. It had also been cited 
by the Supreme Court that 
delay in seeking the relief. It 
stated that, she shall not be 
entitled for an appointment 
on the ground that after a 
number of years from the 
death of the deceased employee.
At the outset, it was found 
by the High Court that 
the Petitioner had raised 
a claim for compassionate 
employment with a delay of 
about 13 years.
The court observed that 
the facts reflected from the 
record that the petitioner 
is married before death of 
her father, as such, she cannot be dependent on 
earning of her father and had 
coupled with the fact that 
the present application has 
been filled by her for grant 
of compassionate appointment after 12 years of death 
of her father. Thus, these 
grounds clearly dis-entitle 
the petitioner to get compassionate appointment. 
Further, the court explained that the very object 
of providing compassion- 
ate appointment is to ameliorate the condition of the 
family at the relevant of 
time. If the family survives 
for such a long period (13 
years), then it has no such 
legal right to get compassionate appointment after 
lapse of several years.
In the present case, the 
petitioner, the married 
daughter Meena Sidar of 
the deceased had made a 
representation before the 
Secretary, Energy and Power Department (Respondent 
1) seeking grant of compassionate appointment which 
was rejected on the ground 
by the respondents that an 
application for the same is 
to be made within one year 
of the death of deceased person. As the petitioner was 
way beyond the limitation 
period, the respondent no 1 
rejected her application.

The Jharkhand High Court 
in the case Rajesh Kacchap and others v. State of 
Jharkhand and others observed and has refused to 
stay proceedings against 
three suspended Congress 
legislators from Jharkhand 
(Irfan Ansari, Rajesh Kachchap, and Naman 
Bixal Kongari) who were arrested by 
the West Bengal Police in 
July 2022 after alleging that 
around ₹49 lakh in cash was 
seized from their vehicle. 
The bench comprising 
of Justice Sanjay Kumar 
Dwivedi observed and has 
allowed the Kolkata Police 
to continue investigating the 
case, therefore, the court has 
asked the police not to file a 
charge sheet in the matter till 
the next date of the hearing. 
It was observed that the 
bench has also issued notices to the Jharkhand and 
Bengal governments in this 
matter and they have been 
directed to file their replies 
by December 1.
Further, it may be noted 
that this order has been 
passed on the pleas moved 
by the suspended Congress 
legislators challenging the 
transfer of zero FIR registered against them [from 
Ranchi to West Bengal] and 
has urged for the quashing 
of the FIR.
At the outset, the High 
Court noted that when the 
cause of action is shown to 
have occurred in the State of 
Jharkhand, then why Zero 
FIR was required to be registered and the same was to 
be transferred to another 
State?
The court took into account the order of the 
Calcutta High Court, granting 
interim bail to the petitioners/suspended congress 
MLAs, wherein it was observed by the Calcutta HC 
that although the allegations 
made are that the petitioners 
had been arrested with unaccounted cash was in the 
public domain by the evening of 30.07.2022, this fact 
was significantly absent in 
the FIR which was lodged in 
Jharkhand, on the next day.
It was opined by the 
Jharkhand High Court that 
it was required to answer 
a ‘very important’ question 
with regard to the territorial jurisdiction of the High 
Court and therefore, both 
the Jharkhand and West 
Bengal governments have 
been called upon for filling 
their responses in this regard.

The Allahabad High Court 
in the case Amarjeet v. State 
Of U.P. Thru. Addl. Chief 
Secy. Prin. Secy. Home, 
Lko. Lko. And 4 Others 
observed and has granted 
pre-arrest bail to a Rape accused till the completion of 
the investigation or till the 
filing of the police report 
charge sheet.
The bench comprising 
of Justice Rajesh Singh 
Chauhan observed and has 
granted relief to the accused 
as it noted that both, the 
victim and accused have 
married each other and are 
living happily as husband 
and wife.
The court observed and 
has remarked that without 
entering into merits of the 
issue, considering the arguments of learned counsel 
for the parties, the material 
available on record, the allegations and contents of the 
F.I.R., the undisputed fact 
by the parties that the applicant and the prosecutrix 
got married and are living 
happily together, therefore, 
the investigation is going on 
and the undertaking of the 
present applicant that he 
shall co-operate with the investigation and shall never 
misuse the liberty of anticipatory bail, the court find it 
appropriate that liberty of 
the present application may 
be protected till completion 
of the investigation or till 
filing of the police report or 
the charge-sheet under Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C.
In the present case, the 
FIR was lodged by the 
mother of the victim on 
the allegations that the Accused (Amarjeet) enticed 
away her minor daughter 
and raped her. Thus, the 
accused was booked under 
Sections 363 & 366 I.P.C., 
however during the investigation, Section 376 I.P.C. 
and Sections 7 and Section 
8 of the POCSO Act were 
added.
However, the accused 
moved the instant prearrest bail plea by 
submitting that he was in love 
with the prosecutrix and 
both of them got married 
on August 2, 2022, and on 
that day and she was above 
18 years of age, thus, at the 
time of lodging F.I.R. she 
was about 17 years of age, 11 
months and 07 days.
Further, it was submitted by her hat both of them 
are living together and 
the prosecutrix has got no 
grievance of any kind whatsoever against the present 
applicant. The case was also 
supported by the counsel 
appearing for the victim. 
It had been directed by 
the High Court that in the 
event of arrest, the accused 
be released on anticipatory 
bail in the case till completion of the investigation, on 
his furnishing a personal 
bond of Rs.25,000 with 
two sureties each in the like 
amount to the satisfaction 
of the arresting authority

Further, the DCs elaborated the steps taken regarding 
utilization of available machinery, IEC activities 
especially in all hotspot villages, 
extending assistance to 
the ex-situ projects in their 
districts, interaction with 
the farmer communities 
and further informed that 
they are keeping strict vigil 
on the burning incidences. 
Haryana, Punjab and U.P. 
assured that with effective 
implementation of action 
plan, utilization of the CRM 
machinery, effective public 
campaign and strict enforcement, they would 
ensure substantial reduction
in crop burning incidents 
this year.

Following the commencement of the 20th National Party 
Congress, the incoming new military generals are likely to 
face challenges as Chinese President Xi Jinping has unleashed 
sweeping changes to the structure of the country’s military, 
according to Reuters analysis.
Following the world’s largest military modernization by the 
Chinese premier, the new military commissions may lack 
combat experience than their commission predecessors as 
Beijing has made extensive changes to leadership that 
directs China’s two million-strong People’s Liberation Army 
(PLA). According to Reuters analysis, Generals Xu Qiliang, 
vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and Zhang 
Youxia, both 72 are expected to step down. Their official 
replacements include recent commanders from the reformed 
Eastern and Western theatre commands, responsible for 
Taiwan and the Indian border respectively and promotions mat 
also come from the Southern Theatre Command.
“There is no shortage of senior military officers who 
internally parrot Xi’s ‘fight and win’ mantra, but the conundrum 
for the PLA is the lack of operational experience,” said a 
private military analyst, Alexander Neill, according to Reuters. 
Moreover, senior retirees Zhang and commission member 
General Li Zuocheng are some of the last two serving officers 
to have fought in the bloody border conflict with Vietnam, 
and Zhang is said to be a very close confidante of Xi Jinping. 
Beijing has, over the last few years expanded its military 
and has taken stringent measures to make it more potent by 
reforming its command operations, and building bases deep 
in the maritime heart of Southeast Asia, the analysis stated. 
James Char, a security scholar at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam 
School of International Studies, said the PLA suffered from 
“shortcomings” in combined arms and joint operations. 
“Its capacity for sustained power projection also remains 
limited at present,” Reuters analysis informs quoting Char. 
Furthermore, China is expected to have 700 deliverable 
nuclear warheads, and 1,000 by 2030, according to the 
Pentagon’s latest annual report on China’s military 
modernization, adding to its power.
Delivering a report to the 20th National Congress in Beijing 
on Sunday, Xi Jinping expressed the desire to quickly elevate 
the people’s armed forces to world-class standards for 
building a modern socialist country.
“We will strengthen Party building across the board in the 
people’s armed forces to ensure that they always obey the 
Party’s command,” Xi was quoted as saying by Xinhua. 
The CCP will intensify troop training and enhance combat 
preparedness across the board, strengthen all-around 
military governance, and enhance integrated national strategies 
and strategic capabilities, Xi said.

More than 600 people have 
been killed in Nigeria as 
catastrophic floods leave the 
African country devastated. 
CNN reported, quoting the 
humanitarian affairs ministry of Nigeria, that more 
than 2 million people have 
been affected by floods and 
over 200,000 homes have 
been completely or partially destroyed. The death 
toll from the worst flooding 
Nigeria has seen in a decade 
has passed 600 people, the 
ministry tweeted on Sunday. 
More than 200,000 homes 
have been completely or partially damaged, it added. The 
recent floods have been one 
of the worst kinds the country has seen in a decade. The 
flooding in certain areas has 
been more severe than the 
last major floods in 2012. 
Nigeria’s Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Sadiya 
Umar Farouq, warned Sunday that more flooding was 
likely and urged regional 
governments to prepare 
accordingly. Earlier this 
month, Nigeria’s National 
Emergency Management 
Agency warned of catastrophic flooding for 
several regions located along 
the courses of the Niger and 
Benue rivers, CNN reported. 
The ministry of humanitarian affairs said on Twitter 
Sunday that it was calling on 
the respective state governments, local government 
councils, and communities 
to prepare for more flooding by evacuating people 
living on flood plains to high 
grounds, providing tents 
and relief materials, fresh 
water, and medical supplies 
for a possible outbreak of 
water-borne diseases,” the 
ministry of humanitarian affairs said on Twitter Sunday. 
Nigeria will soon implement its National Flood 
Emergency Preparedness 
and Response Plan targeted 
at improving coordination 
of the flood response efforts. 
Moreover, relief efforts are 
underway amid the devastation the country has suffered 
due to a lack of preparedness 
for the natural disaster.

After decades of enmity, Israel and Lebanon last week 
signed a historic agreement 
agreeing to demarcate their 
maritime boundaries and 
also demarcating the disputed area in Qanaa 
prospect, which is believed to be 
rich in oil and gas reserves. 
Further, it has, in a de-facto 
manner, forced Lebanon to 
accept Israel as a sovereign 
nation, which it has refused 
to do so till now, as it maintains no diplomatic relations 
with Israel.  The disputed 
860-square-kilometer area 
of the Mediterranean Sea 
potentially holds billions of 
dollars’ worth of oil and gas. 
Tensions between Israel 
and Lebanon worsened earlier this year when, in June, 
a London-based vessel arrived to develop a gas field 
for Israel.
 Though at present, the 
deal seems to be a win for 
both sides, future security 
threats can’t be ruled out after this maritime agreement.
Welcome to 
lebanon
Lebanese Deputy Speaker 
Elias Bou Saab has described 
the maritime border agreement as a “game changer” 
with the hope that “people 
will start talking to Lebanon 
again,” adding that the deal 
will give Lebanon’s youth 
“hope.”
For the Lebanese government, it may prove to be a 
shot in the arm to bolster its 
flailing economy and work 
out a package that puts the 
nation back on track for economic recovery and attracts 
potential investors. 
Under the US-brokered 
deal, Lebanon would be able 
to begin gas exploration in 
the Qanaa prospect—which 
lies within Lebanon’s exploration block but crosses over 
into Israeli waters. The Qanaa gas field is yet to be 
explored, but Lebanon believes 
it is rich with resources. It is 
currently estimated to be 
worth around $3 billion 
(€3.08 billion) altogether. 
That could bring Lebanon 
between $100 and $200 
million a year.
However, the immediate 
economic benefits from Qanaa for Lebanon seem to be 
too farfetched, as its current 
infrastructure is in poor or 
nascent condition, and it’ll 
not be able to start extracting natural gas and oil immediately. At the earliest, it 
may take another four to five 
years.
If TotalEnergies does indeed begin exploration for 
the Lebanese, it could also 
offer incentives for other 
companies to get involved. 
With these prospects in 
mind, it is yet to be seen what 
the direct economic impacts 
will be.
For Israel also, the potential earnings may start 
after four to five years, once 
it signs agreements with 
France’s TotalEnergies to 
explore the whole block.
IsraelI response
As for the Israeli politicians, 
they have already started 
hailing it as a decisive victory against Iran-backed 
and Lebanon-based Hezbollah. These politicians, led by 
Prime Minister Yair Lapid, 
seem to be in a hurry to get 
the agreement approved by 
the government and thus be 
able to mobilise the votes in 
their favour in the upcoming general elections in the 
country on 1 November. 
But the right-wing elements in Israel, led by for- 
mer PM Benjamin Netanyahu, have described the 
agreement as a failure of the 
centrist-Lapid government 
and describe this as conceding ground to Hezbollah, 
which may get further bolstered after this agreement. 
But the US negotiator, 
Amos Hochstein, dismissed 
Netanyahu’s criticisms as 
campaign rhetoric, saying the fact that two enemy 
countries managed to reach 
an agreement on a maritime 
border is “enormously significant.” Overall, a regional 
security crisis seems to have 
been averted due to the economic interests of both sides. 
Following the deal’s approval by the cabinet, the 
agreement was presented 
to the Knesset for a review 
over the next two weeks, 
but without asking for the 
parliament’s approval. Israel’s Attorney General, Gali 
Baharav-Miara, has opined 
that the current government 
is legally entitled to sign the 
maritime border agreement 
and did not need to hold a 
referendum on the issue. 
He also suggested it would 
be preferable for the government to allow a Knesset 
historic pactvote on the issue, 
though it’s 
under no legal obligation to 
do so.
Members of the Likud and 
other right-wing parties approached Knesset speaker 
Mickey Levy, demanding 
that the agreement be put to 
a parliamentary vote. 
Countering Netanyahu’s 
criticism Defence Minister 
Benny Gantz has said the 
talks started under his leadership, and if he were prime 
minister, he would probably 
“rush to sign the deal right 
now.” Gantz also said that 
the deal also “has the potential to reduce Iran’s influence 
on Lebanon.”
Meanwhile, discounting al- 
legations of Lebanon gaining 
an upper hand in the agreement, Israel’s National Secu- 
rity Adviser Eyal Hulata said 
though Lebanon received almost all of the waters under 
dispute with Israel, it did 
not receive what it was really after.
behInd the scenes 
negotIators
This brings out into the open 
the real negotiators behind 
the deal. The negotiations 
started months ago at the 
US insistence and were brokered by France. French 
diplomats helped US negotiator 
Amos Hochstein to stitch the 
deal together.
Thus, apart from political 
gains for the ruling coalition 
in Israel, the agreement also 
brings political benefits for 
US President Joe Biden, who 
also faces mid-term elections 
for both houses next month. 
US mediation efforts were 
key to achieving the deal, 
and it may bolster the Biden 
administration ahead of the 
midterm elections. Biden 
might use this agreement 
to assuage the rising resentment amongst the American 
public due to the constantly 
increasing prices of oil and 
gas in America. 
Meanwhile, Europe’s 
gas crisis is increasing day 
by day. European governments are doing all they can 
to shield consumers from 
price shocks, but the crisis took a further dip after 
explosions damaged Nord 
Stream 1 and 2 last month. 
The Nord Stream 1 pipeline 
was Europe’s main source of 
Russian gas.
Israel has said that, once 
the maritime deal is signed 
and delivered, it can begin 
extracting oil and gas from 
its Karish field and export it 
to Europe within weeks. 
Lapid has repeatedly spoken about the role Israel 
can play in helping Europe 
as Western countries try to 
wean themselves off Russian energy.
This development comes 
in the background of worsening US-Saudi relations, 
which hit a new low last 
week when OPEC+, led by 
Saudi Arabia and Russia, 
defied the US with the largest output cut since the 
pandemic, adding additional 
pressure on the Biden Administration.
But it is also a regional victory for the Biden 
administration, which lately has seen 
diplomatic tensions rise with 
some of its Middle Eastern 
allies. With the possibility of 
much needed gas from the 
Mediterranean and averting 
a potential security crisis 
between historic enemies, 
the United States notched 
an important win in a region where its influence has 
seemingly diminished.

As the war between 
Russia and Ukraine 
continues to escalate, children in both 
countries have been most affected by its economic fallout, 
said UNICEF regional director for Europe and 
Central Asia, Afshan Khan, Al 
Jazeera reported. 
According to a report by 
the United Nations children’s 
agency, the study of 22 countries showcased how the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine 
and the ongoing crisis 
pushed approximately four 
million children into poverty 
across Eastern Europe and 
Central Asia. “Children are 
bearing the heaviest burden 
of the economic crisis caused 
by the war in Ukraine,” UNICEF said.
The report further noted 
that due to the ongoing economic slump, an additional 
2.8 million children are now 
living in households below 
the poverty line. 
Moreover, Romania has a 
further 110,000 children living in poverty, Al Jazeera 
reported. Children all over the 
region are being swept up in 
this war’s terrible wake,” said 
UNICEF regional director
for Europe and Central Asia, 
Afshan Khan. 
This could well translate 
into an additional 4,500 children dying before their first 
birthdays, and an additional 
117,000 children dropping 
out of school this year alone, 
Al Jazeera reported, quoting UNICEF. 
Another report by UNICEF, which was released 
economic challenges
against surety Bond
recently, stated that nearly 
1,000 boys and girls have 
been killed or injured in the 
war in Ukraine. 
At least 972 children in 
Ukraine have been killed 
or injured by violence since 
the war escalated nearly six 
months ago, an average of 
over five children killed or 
injured each day, UNICEF 
Executive Director Catherine 
Russell said in a statement. 
The Russia-Ukraine war 
began nearly six months ago. 
The full scope of the Ukrainian refugee crisis is difficult to 
quantify and far exceeds any 
other refugee crisis in Europe 
since World War II. 
almost every child in 
Ukraine has been exposed 
to deeply distressing events. 
Those fleeing violence are 
at significant risk of family separation, abuse, sexual 
exploitation, further attacks, 
and trafficking.

The Chinese government is trying every 
possible way to censor any discussion 
of a rare public protest that condemned 
President Xi Jinping as a “despotic 
traitor” and denounced the Covid policy. 
As China’s ruling Communist Party’s 
twice-a-decade National Congress has 
already started, Xi doesn’t want to 
deviate from his goal, The New York Times 
reported. On Thursday, a column 
appeared over the Sitong Bridge overpass 
in the Haidian district of Beijing, openly 
bashing China’s President and 
criticising their zero-Covid policy, including 
one calling for “freedom and not 
lockdowns.” 
People on social media quickly shared 
the videos and photos of the protest. But 
as soon as the Chinese government saw 
the post, they quickly removed them, 
but in this digital cat-and-mouse game, 
some tech-smart users indirectly coded 
the messages before the censors could 
catch on. Chinese censors have 
restricted searches about the episode on Weibo, 
amid escalation
A
China’s equivalent of Twitter, blocking 
certain hashtags, including “Beijing,” 
“Sitong Bridge” and “Haidian.” Other 
seemingly related terms that appeared 
to be blocked from searches on the 
social media platform were “courage,” 
“Beijing banner” and “warrior,” reported The New York Times.
China is already on high alert as the 
party congress, which occurs every 
five years, has already started on 
Sunday. At the meeting, Xi is expected to 
coast to a third term as leader. Eight
marked police cars were parked under 
and around the bridge on Friday, and 
crowds of plainclothes officers in black 
sweatpants stood to watch on the street 
corners. When reporters began taking 
photos of the bridge, four plainclothes 
officers immediately ran over and 
ordered them to delete the photos. They 
said taking photos there was prohibited 
because of “special circumstances.”The 
censoring also extended beyond search 
terms on social media with a connection 
to the incident.

Urvashi Rautela has 
decided to chop off 
her hair after calling
herself a victim of “bullying” 
online and comparing her 
situation to that of Mahsa 
Amini. She extended support to Iranian women and 
girls who have been killed 
in protests at the death of 
Mahsa Amini.
On Monday, Urvashi took 
to Instagram to share a photo 
where she can be seen getting her hair chopped. She 
wrote a message along with 
the photo-”CHOPPED MY 
HAIR OFF! I am cutting my 
hair in support of Iranian 
women and girls who have 
been killed in protests at the 
death of Mahsa Amini, after 
her arrest by Iranian morality police and for all the girls. 
And for 19-year-old girl Ankita Bhandari from Uttara- 
khand.”
“Around the world women 
are uniting in protest against 
the Iranian government by 
cutting their hair. Respect 
Women. A Global Symbol 
For Women’s Revolution. 
Hair is seen as a symbol of 
the beauty of women. By 
chopping off hair it in public, women are showing that 
they don’t care about society’s beauty standards and 
won’t let anything or anyone 
decide how they dress up, behave or live,” she continued. 
Urvashi concluded by saying, “Once women come 
together and consider one 
woman’s issue as an issue of 
the entire womankind, feminism will see a new vigour.” 
Urvashi is currently in Australia, and since she revealed 
that she is there, netizens 
have been brutally trolling 
her for “stalking Rishabh 
Pant”.
She then took to Instagram 
to express her displeasure 
and asked people to stop 
“bullying” her. However, 
people again trolled her 
because she compared her 
situation with that of Mahsa 
Amini, an Iranian girl who 
was arrested in Tehran on 
September 13 for dressing 
“inappropriately,” and died 
three days later while in custody.
Mahsa Amini’s death 
sparked demonstrations and 
clashes with security forces 
where many lost their lives. 
More than 100 people 
have been killed in nationwide protests over the death 
of Mahsa Amini, according 
to the Norway-based group 
Iran Human Rights (IHR) 
NGO. Iranian schoolgirls 
and women have come out
n huge numbers to demonstrate by removing their 
hijabs and staging rallies in 
protest over Amini’s death. 
Coming back to Urvashi, 
she uploaded a video of her 
last week and wrote, “First 
in Iran #MahsaAmini and 
now in India, it’s happening 
with me they’re bullying me 
as a stalker ??? No one cares 
about me or support me.” 
She added, “A strong woman is one who feels deeply 
and loves fiercely. Her tears 
flow as abundantly as her 
laughter. She is both soft 
and powerful, both practical and spiritual. She’s a gift 
to the world.”

It is becoming more widely acknowl- 
edged that the psychedelic substances 
present in “magic mushrooms” have 
the ability to treat diseases like addiction, obsessive disorder, anxiety, and 
depression.
However, little is understood about 
these substances’ evolution and function in the natural world.
To address this, researchers from the 
University of Plymouth are carrying out 
a ground-breaking investigation utilising cutting-edge genetic techniques 
and behavioural studies to address 
unproven claims regarding the origin 
of psychedelic chemicals in fungi.This 
includes determining whether such 
qualities originated as a line of defence 
against invertebrates that feed on mushrooms or whether the fungi themselves 
create substances that control insect behaviour for their own advantages. 
The initiative will pay close attention 
to psilocybin, a substance frequently 
found in ‘magic mushrooms’. It is highly 
similar to serotonin chemically, which 
plays a role in the communication of 
information between nerve cells in animals.
To determine whether there is a varied 
animal community feeding on psychedelic mushrooms, the researchers are 
sampling psychedelic and non-psychedelic fungi and utilising next-generation 
DNA sequencing.
Additionally, they are performing laboratory procedures to look into whether 
the fungi experience genetic changes 
throughout development and attack. 
They will also look into how psilocybin 
affects the growth of soil microbes. 
Modern gene editing techniques will 
also be used in the study to attempt to 
produce mutant fungi that are incapable of synthesising psilocybin. In the 
future, it is believed that this will aid 
researchers in understanding the function of a variety of fungal substances. 
Molecular Ecology, animal-plant interactions, and fungal biology experts 
from the university’s School of Biological and Marine Sciences are lead- 
ing the project. Dr Kirsty Matthews 
Nicholass, a postdoctoral research 
fellow, and Ms Ilona Flis, a research 
assistant, are leading the project. 
Dr Jon Ellis, Lecturer in Conservation Genetics, is supervising the 
study. He said, “In recent years, there 
has been a resurgence of interest in 
psychedelic compounds from a human health perspective. However, 
almost nothing is known about the 
evolution of these compounds in nature and why fungi should contain 
neurotransmitter-like compounds is 
unresolved.”
“The hypotheses that have been suggested for their evolution have never 
been formally tested, and that is what 
makes our project so ambitious and 
novel. It could also in future lead to 
exciting future discoveries, as the development of novel compounds that 
could be used as fungicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and antibiot- 
ics is likely to arise from ‘blue-sky’ research investigating fungal defence.” 
Dr Kirsty Matthews Nicholass said, 
“Within Psilocybe alone, there are 
close to 150 hallucinogenic species 
distributed across all continents except Antarctica. Yet, the fungal species 
in which these ‘magic’ compounds 
occur are not always closely related. 
This raises interesting questions regarding the ecological pressures that 
may be acting to maintain the biosynthesis pathway for psilocybin.”

Skin cancer, though 
uncommon, is increasing. It can easily be detected externally by regular 
visits to the dermatologist. 
The whole body will be 
examined, and suspicious 
lesions will be frozen or biopsied, depending on their 
appearance.
Types of skin CanCer
There are three major types 
of skin cancer:
l Basal cell carcinoma: This 
type of skin cancer usually 
appears on the surface of the 
skin. It is limited to the upper layers of the skin. It is not 
invasive and easy to treat via 
surgery.
l  Squamous cell carcinoma: It is commonly found 
in the areas of the body that 
are exposed to friction, carcinogenic substances, and 
in individuals with a genetic 
predisposition to cancer.
l Melanoma: Melanoma 
can develop anywhere in 
your body. It usually develops from the cells that give 
your skin colour melanocytes. It is the most 
aggressive form of skin cancer and 
is dangerous. Early detection is the key to preventing 
it from spreading.
are bleeding moles 
a Common sign of 
The disease?
Irregular moles, freckles, or 
warts are common signs of 
skin cancer that are present 
on the skin and can appear 
alone or in groups. They 
are usually black or dark 
brown and can also develop 
as a pimple-like bump on the 
skin, due to which they are 
easily ignored or dismissed. 
The majority of the moles 
are non-cancerous, and it is 
normal to have 10–40 moles 
from early childhood to 25 
years of age. 
As a person reaches adulthood, they may experience 
sudden changes that are 
evident in the structure of 
the moles in terms of their 
colours, size, and texture. 
In some cases, hair may also 
develop in the mole, where 
as in other cases, the moles, 
freckles, or warts may slowly 
disappear.
Therefore, observing your 
moles and identifying the 
signs and symptoms of skin 
cancer is important. You 
may get worried while differentiating between a mole 
or a pimple and may selfdiagnose or misdiagnose it, 
thinking it is a sign of cancer. 
Identifying moles depends 
on the size, colour, height, 
and shape. Bleeding moles 
Dr namrata ruPani
are more dangerous and if 
they ooze, itch or suddenly 
become painful or tender, 
you should consult a dermatologist.
In case the colour of the 
wart or moles is distinct 
from that of each other in 
terms of diameter, evolution or colour then it may be 
non-cancerous. If the moles 
or warts are red, white, pink 
or are appearing on the neck 
or face with changes in size, 
shape, and colour, then it 
is advisable to have them 
checked by a dermatologist. 
Prevention is better than 
cure in cases of skin cancer. 
Regular skin checks with your 
dermatologist is key in early 
detection of skin cancers.
how Can you deTeCT 
skin CanCer aT 
home?
There are several easy ways 
through which you can detect potential cancerous 
growth at home. This includes the ABCDE test  
A: Stands for asymmetry 
test where you should look 
out for moles that are uneven 
or asymmetrical
B: Stands for the border. In
this, you need to check for 
irregular borders on moles. 
C:  Is for colour and melanomas range from white, 
pink, black, blue, or red. 
D: This is for diameter 
where you should look out 
for moles that are larger 
than 1/4 inch or are the size 
of a pencil eraser which may 
indicate the emergence of 
melanoma.
E: Means evolving and 
you should keep an eye out 
for moles that are changing 
size, shape, or symptoms like 
itching, pain, or bleeding. 
Skin cancer also doesn’t always appear on the skin and 
can manifest near the lungs, 
causing shortness of breath. 
If melanoma appears on 
the head, then it can lead to 
headaches or vision changes. If diagnosed early, then 
the five-year survival rate 
for skin cancer is 99%. It is 
a treatable condition, but if 
left untreated it can be fatal. 
It is important to regularly 
examine your skin for any 
signs of cancer.

Everyone desires the results 
of meticulous dental care a 
gleaming white smile, fresh 
smelling breath, and healthy 
pink gums. Good oral hygiene is essential in the 
prevention of diseases affecting 
the heart and lungs, and is 
therefore, recommended for 
everyone. As a result, taking care of your teeth and 
gums is essential no matter 
how old you are if you want 
to stay healthy overall. No 
matter how many compliments you’ve received on 
the appearance of your teeth, 
it’s still important to take the 
necessary precautions each 
day to keep them that way. 
Here are some at-home 
methods that can assist you 
in reaching your objective:
BruSh tWice Daily
A fluoride toothpaste and a 
two-to-three-minute brushing routine, twice daily, are 
AfRICA: 46% 
SoUTH
AMERICA: 28%
recommended. Plaque, a bacterial film that accumulates on 
your teeth, can be removed 
with regular tooth brushing. 
This plaque bacteria, when 
left untreated, causes tooth 
enamel that leads to cavities, 
forms tartar, and both are 
difficult to remove from the 
teeth. Inflammation, brought 
on by tartar build-up, is what 
causes gum disease. For this 
reason, it’s crucial to establish 
a regular brushing practice.
FloSS at leaSt 
once a Day
Plaque and bacteria can be removed from in between teeth 
by flossing in areas where the 
toothbrush doesn’t reach. 
When plaque builds up and 
isn’t regularly removed, it can 
cause cavities and gum disease.  On that account, flossing 
is an effective method of gum 
stimulation, plaque removal, 
and reduction of gum inflammation.
uSe a mouthWaSh
An effective mouthwash 
can neutralise excess acid, 
eliminate bad breath, remove 
plaque from hard-to-reach 
places in and around the 
gums, and even re-mineralize 
tooth enamel. Plaque and gingivitis can also be prevented 
or treated with the use of a 
mouthwash. You can also 
ask your dentist for advice on 
the best mouthwash for your 
specific needs. Mouthwash 
cannot replace brushing 
and flossing, but it can help 
to supplement these habits.
Quit Smoking
Smoking has been identified 
as a risk factor for gum disease, which can lead to tooth 
loss and, in severe cases, 
mouth cancer. Many people, 
however, are unaware of the 
damage smoking causes to 
their lips, gums, and teeth. 
Additionally, smokers may 
experience poor healing following a dental operation. 
Smoking also has an impact 
on the aesthetics of the mouth, 
causing yellowing of the teeth 
and tongue, and giving you 
bad breath. Whatever the 
case, smoking is never a good 
habit.
change your 
toothbrush every 2 months 
is essential to keep the bristles effective and germ 
accumulation on the toothbrush 
to a minimum.
viSit the DentiSt 
every Six monthS
Maintaining ideal oral 
health requires practicing proper oral hygiene at 
home, but regular dentist 
appointments should not be 
missed.
Even diligent brushers and 
flossers need regular dental 
check-ups. At the very least, 
you should see your dentist 
every six months for clean- 
ings and check-ups. This 
is especially important if 
you have a history of dental 
problems, such as gingivitis 
or cavities. 
A dentist can not only remove calculus and check for 
cavities, but they can also 
identify possible problems 
and suggest relevant treatment options.
These practices can help 
everyone achieve and maintain optimal dental health 
throughout their lives and 
enjoy all the benefits that 
come with it.
Dr Namrata Rupani is the 
Founder and CEO of Capture 
Life Dental Care. 
Your toothbrush combats 
the germs that cause gum 
disease, tooth decay, and 
bad breath. Brushing your 
teeth twice a day is likely 
if you practice appropriate oral hygiene. But how 
often do you change your 
toothbrush, which is the 
instrument you use to wipe 
plaque off your teeth and 
gums daily? When you use 
your toothbrush as directed, the soft bristles fray and 
possibly hazardous bacteria 
accumulate.

Premature greying has become a leading cause of con- 
cern for people in their 20s 
and 30s. This early onset of 
hair greying can have a negative impact on self-esteem. 
Young men and women have 
resorted to dyeing their hair 
to hide their white roots. College students in their early 
20s are ridiculed and name called for their greying 
tresses, and the same treatment is 
meted out to young couples 
who have begun to show salt 
and pepper hair. All of this 
puts a major dent in people’s 
confidence and impacts their 
day-to-day lives. Such societal pressures are compel- 
ling more and more young 
people to look for remedies 
that will reverse their greying hair.
The onset of grey hair in the 
early years can largely be attributed to today’s lifestyle. 
Inappropriate diets without 
adequate nutrition, smoking, 
alcohol consumption, and 
lack of exercise combined 
with the stresses of daily 
pressures lead to deteriorated levels of antioxidants in 
the body, i.e., oxidative stress. 
This hampers the produc- 
tion of melanin (black pigment), which in turn leads 
to the greying of hair. 
Fortunately, the entire 
process can be combated by 
an antioxidant-based treatment to reverse premature 
hair greying. Antioxidants 
can help stop the melanocytes from getting exhausted 
while reversing premature 
greying and hair ageing 
from the very root. This will 
reduce the density and number of white hairs.
It is a science-backed safe 
approach that has been proven to be effective by various 
studies.
Thanks to various research 
conducted across the globe, 
many ingredients have 
been proven to be effective 
against premature greying. 
Hair Prime Serum, which 
contains Arcolys, can help 
prevent premature greying 
by reducing oxidative stress 
at the hair follicles. Because 
of its antioxidant properties, 
Arcolys promotes melanin 
production at the roots. 
Arcolys is a natural active 
ingredient that has been 
proven to revive hair’s lost 
pigment. It stimulates the 
re-pigmentation of grey hair 
over time while being completely safe for the hair and 
scalp.
Alternatives include hair 
dyes, which can not only 
cause damage and hair fall 
but are also pocket-pinching. 
Hair Prime Serum, on the 
other hand, is a long-term 
solution to treat premature 
hair greying from the roots 
and shows results within 5 
months. It can help in permanently reclaiming the lost 
confidence of those who are 
distressed by hair greying at 
a young age.
Yes, greying hair can be intimidating, but experts 
believe that there is a treatment 
for it. Irrespective of whether 
you are learning to embrace 
your greys or reverse them, 
be sure to complement them 
by making appropriate lifestyle improvements, to keep 
yourself healthy and happy.

The world is advanc- 
ing at a furious pace. 
Today, we are living in a world where there 
is tremendous pressure to 
perform, achieve and continuously reinvent ourselves. 
The terms ‘Quiet Quitting’, 
‘Remote Working’ and ‘The 
Great Resignation’ are on everyone’s lips. As companies 
are telling employees to get 
back to office, employees are 
going through immense crises. If one doesn’t saddle up, 
then there are a hundred oth- 
ers waiting to take their place. 
There is immense peer pressure and anxiety among the 
young workers, frustrated 
with a post-pandemic culture where decision makers 
are often not open to experimenting with new and radical 
ideas and unwilling to let the 
creativity of the younger generation flower. On the other 
hand, the older generations, 
including millennials, who 
are now in their 40s, need to 
break away from ‘old-school’ 
thinking. In fact, there is little tolerance for the youth’s 
rapidly changing goals leading young people to anger 
and violence as they feel
misunderstood. They have 
started breaking away from 
convention- at times only 
rebelling because they aren’t 
understood  by  their senior 
colleagues. 
Today’s youth are moving 
into radically different fields 
and earning pretty well. They 
love to spend, and rarely save 
up. For most Gen X, what 
starts as a convenience, like 
a bike, a mobile phone, a 
gaming laptop, or even eating out, gradually becomes a 
fashion statement to achieve 
one-upmanship. This kind of 
life, where one is only bothered about how one is seen by 
the people one is surrounded 
by, rather than what one really needs, is making people 
extremely stressed. 
Ironically, this has started 
the trend in youth looking 
for spiritual practices to make 
them strong from within to 
achieve a balance and regain 
the peace of mind, body and spirit. Spirituality is fast 
becoming a hot draw for Gen X. 
So, what does spirituality 
and religion mean to youth? 
Most youth confuse religion 
with spirituality. Leading 
a fast life, one is looking for 
succour and peace of mind. 
This has led to resurgence of 
interest in religious practices. 
Joining a yoga or tai-chi class, 
chanting mantras and reading Mythology is now seen 
as cool. This is a good thing 
as many young people have 
started questioning them- 
selves and their lifestyle. They 
are choosing a minimalistic 
life and have started exploring the spiritual path.
For a few, though, spirituali- 
ty has become a fashion statement. There are some who 
learn technique after technique, just so that they can 
stand out among their peers. 
But more often than not, Gen 
X is looking for the freedom 
to express themselves, and 
they aren’t satisfied with the 
answers that are being given 
to them. Although, whatever 
the reason to become involved 
with spiritual practices, they 
would certainly benefit- and 
eventually transform into 
sincere seekers.
Practice of religion is a popular doorway to exploration 
of spiritual life. It is ironic that 
many people ‘rediscover’ and 
return to their religion once 
they become older. Many 
millennials are getting back 
to their roots and celebrate 
religious festivals with newfound fervour. 
All de-stressing practices 
are in a way spiritual. The 
label of spirituality gives it 
higher credibility. Today 
many young people are keen 
to learn to meditate and to 
find answers to questions 
from within themselves. 
What is really attracting 
youth is an innate desire to 
find themselves, and go beyond the mundane lifestyles 
that they are leading- money, 
drugs, smoking and alcohol, 
sex, gadgets, fast life and 
achievements which they 
realise, really lead nowhere. 
Thus, to de-stress, most Gen 
X are ‘Quiet Quitting’ the 
trappings of materialistic 
lifestyle and choosing a minimalistic spiritual life.

Sar Indian javelin thrower Neeraj 
Chopra made a trip down the 
memory lane by attending the 
‘Thank You Tokyo!’ event, coming 
back to the National Stadium, a venue 
where he was pushed to stardom following his Tokyo Olympics 2020 gold 
medal triumph.
As per the Olympics.com, the Olympic champion was in the Japanese 
capital on Sunday to attend the event, 
which was organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 
collaboration with the Tokyo Metropolitan 
Government and the Japanese Olympic 
Committee to commemorate the successful hosting of the global sporting 
event last year. The people of Japan were 
also appreciated for making the event a 
huge success despite challenges posed 
by the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost 
18,000 people turned out to watch the 
event, which involved a series of sports 
initiations and demonstrations from top 
athletes. The massive crowd, which had 
not turned up to stadium due to the pandemic, 
now got to see the sight of Neeraj 
storming down the runway and hurling 
a javelin once again, just like he did 
during his Olympics triumph. “Had a great 
time at the #Tokyo2020 Commemoration 
Ceremony today, and was a special 
feeling being back at the stadium where 
it all changed for me. Thank you to @ iocmedia
, @gorin and @Tokyo2020 for the invite! #ThankYouTokyo 
#arigatouDong 
Jing ,” tweeted Neeraj.
Olympics-themed cultural activities, 
chances to get clicked with Olympians 
like Neeraj, Sydney McLaughlin, the 
women’s 400m hurdles gold medallist 
from Tokyo 2020, and women’s high 
jump silver medallist Nicola Olyslagers 
drew a heavy crowd of eager fans. 
Children also got their faces, nails 
painted with Olympic colours and 
experienced a painting performance by 
Paralympian and artist Gregory Burns. 
Fans also tried sports like climbing, 
athletics, skateboarding, a sport that 
made its Olympic debut last year and 
breaking, which will make its Olympics 
debut in 2024 in Paris.
Star Indian javelin throw athlete 
Neeraj Chopra made history in 
September, becoming the first-ever Indian 
to win the prestigious Diamond League 
trophy, a top-tier athletics competition, 
achieving the best throw of 88.44 m to 
clinch one of the biggest wins of his 
career. His best throw of 88.44 m came in 
his second attempt.

Fiery bowling spells from 
pace trio of Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava and 
an all-round performance 
by Sikandar Raza powered 
Zimbabwe to a 31-run win 
over Ireland in their Group B, 
round one match of ICC T20 
World Cup 2022 in Hobart on 
Monday.
Zimbabwe’s put up a clinical 
performance to tame the Irish, 
a side with a dangerous batting lineup. First, it was Raza’s 
82 off 48 that powered Zimbabwe to 174/7, then Muzarbani 
(3/23) was the lead act in his 
side’s success with the ball, 
restricting Ireland to 143/9 in 
20 overs. Chasing 175, Ireland 
was off to a horrendous start. 
Medium-pace duo of Richard 
Ngarava and Blessing Muzarabani unleashed terror on 
Ireland, sending back Paul 
Stirling (0), Lorcan Tucker 
(11), Harry Tector (1) and 
captain Andrew Balbirnie (3) 
within a space of just 22 runs 
in 3.5 overs.
Curtis Campher and George 
Dockrell joined forces to take 
their side safely through pow- 
erplay overs. At the end of the 
powerplay in six overs, Ireland was at 33/4, with 
Dockrell (4*) and Campher (6*). 
Ireland crossed the 50-run 
mark in eight overs.
The partnership between 
the duo ended at 42 runs after 
a delivery by Sikandar Raza 
castled Dockrell’s middle 
stump. He was back in the 
pavillion for 24 off 20 balls. 
Ireland was five down for 64 
runs.
Campher and Gareth 
Delany added 27 more runs 
to the total before Sean Williams dislodged the former’s 
stumps, dismissing him for 
27 off 22 balls.
Ireland crossed the 100-run 
mark in 13.5 overs and still 
needed 75 runs in 37 balls. 
Medium pacer Tendai 
Chatara strengthened Zimbabwe’s hold in the match, dis- 
missing Delany (24) and Simi 
Singh (0) to reduce their opponents to 102/8 in 14.5 overs. 
Muzarabani got his third 
wicket in the match when he 
dismissed Mark Adair for 9 
off 10 balls. Ireland finished 
their innings at 143/9 in 20 
overs, losing the match by 31 
runs. Barry McCarthy (22*) 
and Joshua Little (7*) were 
unbeaten for their side. 
Muzarbani (3/23) was the 
standout bowler for Zim- 
babwe and troubled the opponents with his line and 
length. Chatara and Ngarava 
took 2/22 each. Williams and 
Raza got one wicket each. Put 
to bat first by Ireland, pacer 
Joshua Little gave Zimbabwe 
two jolts, sending back wicketkeeper-batter Regis 
Chakabva (0) and Wesley Madhevere (22). Skipper Craig 
Ervine was also dismissed 
by spinner Simi Singh after 
being stumped by wicket-keeper-batter Lorcan Tucker 
for 9. Zimbabwe was reduced 
to 37/3 in 5.3 overs. After the 
powerplay, Zimbabwe was 
at 41/3 in six overs, Sikandar 
Raza (2*) and Sean Williams(1*).
Sean Williams and Sikandar 
Raza stabilised the innings, 
keeping the scoreboard ticking. Simi got his second wicket 
in the match on the final ball 
of the 10th over when a relay catch by Mark Adair and 
Harry Tector dismissed Sean 
for 12 off 11 balls. Zimbabwe 
was at 79/4 in 10 overs. Raza 
and Milton Shumba helped 
Zimbabwe cross the 100-run 
mark in 12.2 overs. Raza continued his lethal run of form, 
slamming a full-length delivery by Gareth Delany over 
wide long-on to bring his half-century in just 26 balls.

Arilliant knock from KL Rahul and a three-wicket haul 
masterclass by Mohammed  
Shami helped India inflict a 6 runs 
defeat on Australia and bundled 
out hosts for 180 in ICC Men’s T20

Marsh’s wicket invited Steven 
Smith to the crease. In the 10th over 
of the innings, Finch and Smith 
hammered Harshal Patel for 15 runs. 
In the 11th over Yuzvendra Chahal 
broke the Australian momentum as 
he removed Smith for 11 off 12. Australia’s star all-rounder 
Glenn MaxMohammed Shami
well then came out to bat. 
Maxwell slammed Chahal for 
15 runs while hammering back-to-back two fours in the 13th over 
of the match. Finch in lethal form 
destroyed Arshdeep Singh as he 
slammed the Indian bowler for 17 
runs in the 14th over of the innings. 
Finch also brought up his fifty while 
hammering Indian bowlers all 
around the ground. At this point, no 
Indian bowlers were able to restrict 
Australian batters from smashing 
runs.
Experience pacer Bhuvneshwar 
gave his team a big breakthrough as 
he dismissed Maxwell for 23 runs off  
16 balls. In the last three overs, Australia needed 29 runs to win. 
Harshal Patel was brought back 
into the attack and he proved his 
captain’s decision right as he removed well-set batter Finch for 79 
off 54 in the 19th over of the innings. 
The Australian captain’s knock was 
decorated with seven fours and three  
sixes. At the same over Tim David 
was run out by Virat Kohli.
In the penultimate over Australia needed 11 runs to win and Virat 
Kohli displayed his fine fielding as 
he took a one-handed catch of Pat 
Cummins. On the very next ball of 
the over Ashton Agar was run out 
without opening his tally. On the fifth  
delivery of the over Shami bowled 
out Josh Inglis for one run and bundled out the hosts for 180. 
Shami delivered a stunning last-over spell of 2, 
2, WWWW, helping India to defeat 
Australia by 6 runs.
Earlier, KL Rahul smashed 57 off 
33 while Suryakumar Yadav scored 
50 off 33 to guide Men in Blue to a 
total of 186/7. For Australia Kane 
Richardson scalped stunning four 
wickets while Glenn Maxwell and 
Ashton Agar bagged one wicket 
each. Put to bat first, India got off 
to a decent start as their opener KL 
Rahul hammered Australian bowlers 
all around the ground, smashing 
56 runs in just 5 overs of the innings. 
While smashing Australian bowlers 
Rahul brought up his half-century in  
27 balls. Skipper Rohit Sharma also 
shifted gears and Glenn Maxwell for 
a six and a four in the sixth over of the  
innings. At the end of the powerplay, 
Team India’s score read 69/0.
In the 8th over of the innings, 
Maxwell provided his team with a 
big breakthrough as he dismissed 
blistering batter Rahul for 57 off 33 
deliveries. Rahul’s wicket invited in- 
form batter Virat Kohli to the crease. 
Ashton Agar then provided his 
team with a big wicket of India captain 
Rohit as the batter tried to pull 
a deep mid-wicket shot but handed 
an easy catch to Maxwell in the 9th 
over of the innings. The India captain  
departed after scoring 15 runs in 14 
deliveries. After 10 overs of the play, 
India’s score read 89/2.
New batter Suryakumar Yadav 
and Kohli joined hands to slam 
Australian bowlers for boundar- 
ies while taking singles at regular 
intervals. Kohli’s stint on the crease 
was cut short as he was dismissed 
by Mitchell Starc after scoring for 19 
from 13 balls.
Hardik Pandya then came out to 
bat on the crease, but the latter could 
not do much as he departed after just 
scoring two runs on the delivery of 
Kane Richardson. India kept losing wickets at regular intervals as 
the batters struggled to play against 
Australian bowlers after 10 overs. 
Dinesh Karthik then came out to 
bat. Karthik tried to pull a shot but it 
went straight to the fielder stationed 
at deep mid-wicket on the delivery 
of Richardson. Karthik departed 
after playing a cameo of 20 runs in 
14 delivery. However, Suryakumar 
continued the carnage on the Australian bowlers as he hammered Pat 
Cummins for 14 runs in the 18th over  
of the innings.

The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) announced on 
Monday that Qatar will host 
the Asian Cup 2023 in place 
of the tournament’s original 
hosts, China. Qatar became 
the new host after beating 
off competition from South 
Korea and Indonesia. The announcement came after China 
withdrew earlier this year because of its ‘zero-Covid’ policy. 
“The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) executive 
committee on Monday confirmed that the Qatar 
Football Association (QFA) is the 
host association for the AFC 
Asian Cup 2023,” AFC said 
in a statement.
The continental championships were awarded to China 
in 2019 but the Asian country 
relinquished the rights earlier 
this year as it pursued a zero-COVID policy. The competi- 
tion was scheduled to take 
place in 10 Chinese cities between June 16 and July 16 of 
the next year.
“Chairing the 11th AFC 
Executive Committee meeting, AFC President Shaikh 
Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa congratulated the QFA on 
their successful bid and also 
conveyed the appreciation 
of the Asian football family 
to the Football Association 
of Indonesia (PSSI) and the 
Korea Football Association 
(KFA) for their commendable proposals,” the statement 
further read. “On behalf of the 
A
AFC and the Asian football 
family, I want to congratulate 
the Qatar Football Association 
on being awarded the hosting 
rights of the upcoming edition 
of the AFC Asian Cup. We 
must also thank the Football 
Association of Indonesia and 
the Korea Football Association for outlining their 
intentions to stage the tournament. 
Qatar’s capabilities and track 
record in hosting major international sporting events 
and their meticulous attention to detail are well admired 
throughout the globe. I must 
also commend the AFC for 
showcasing utmost professionalism in conducting a fair 
and transparent expedited 
bidding process and I thank 
all our commercial partners 
and sponsors for their pa- 
tience during these unprecedented times,” AFC President 
Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim 
Al Khalifa said in an official 
statement released by AFC. 
“Given the short lead time 
in preparation, we know that 
the hard work begins immediately but with their existing 
world-class infrastructure 
and unrivalled hosting ca- 
pabilities, we are confident 
that Qatar will stage a worthy 
spectacle befitting the prestige 
and stature of Asia’s crown 
jewel,” he further added.
Qatar are the reigning AFC 
Asian Cup champions and 
will be hosting the continent’s 
most prestigious men’s tournament for the third time 
after staging the 1988 and 2011 
editions.

Scotland made it a second 
consecutive day of upsets at 
the ongoing ICC Men’s T20 
World Cup by registering a 
stunning 42-run victory over 
the West Indies in Hobart on 
Monday.
Opener George Munsey set 
the tone by playing a stylish 
knock of unbeaten 66 from 
just 53 deliveries as Scotland 
amassed 160/5 from their 20 
overs. Calum MacLeod (23), 
Michael Jones (20) and skipper Richie Berrington (16) all 
played valuable hands, but 
it was with the ball and in 
the field that the Scots really 
shone.
The West Indies couldn’t get 
a hold of Mark Watt, with the 
left-arm spinner collecting 
superb figures of 3/12 from his 
four overs, while fellow spinner Michael Leask (2/15) was 
just as impressive.
And the duo were well supported by their teammates in 
the field, with Scotland holding on to some excellent 
outfield catches and showing the 
rest of the world they will be 
difficult to beat at the tournament.
Nicholas Pooran’s West Indies were overpowered on the 
big stage and were bundled 
out for 118 in the penultimate 
over. Veteran all-rounder 
Jason Holder shone with bat 
and ball as he scored 38 and 
bagged two wickets while 
conceding just 14 runs, while 
their top-order showed some 
glimpses of promise with Kyle 
Mayers (20), Evin Lewis (14) 
and Brandon King (17) find- 
ing the boundary a few times 
each.
But beyond that, there was 
not much joy, as the West 
Indies were outplayed in all 
aspects of the game by a Scotland side that were on a 
mission. Brief score: Scotland 160/5 
(George Munsey 66*, Calum 
MacLeod 23; Jason Holder 
2-14) vs West Indies 118 ( Jason Holder 38, Kyle Mayers 
20; Mark Watt 3-12).

Her fencing at the Tokyo 
Olympics will always be 
counted as an epic day in 
India’s sports as the nation 
made it’s debut in a discipline that has been 
showcased at the Summer Games 
since 1896. She made the 
golden chance count after 
coming close to qualifying 
for the Rio Olympics in 2016. 
She didn’t leave any stone 
unturned and eventually 
rose to success in domestic 
circuit before winning a 
bronze medal at the 2009 
Commonwealth Fencing 
Championships, her first 
international medal. Chadalavada Anandha Sundh 
Bhavani aka C.A. Bhavani 
Devi is the first Indian to win 
a silver medal at the Asian 
Championships and is also 
the first from the nation to 
recently in Delhi, below are 
the excerpts.
Q. How are the preparations 
going on for Asian games and 
Paris Olympics 2020?
A. Yes, it’s going very well. 
I’m preparing very hard 
for the Paris and the Asian 
Games. Learning new techniques, new strategies, 
drawing lessons from the 
past matches and amending 
the game as required.
Q. So did you make any 
amendments or any kind of strategical changes in your game, if 
your coach has suggested some? 
A. Yes, definitely we have to 
change according to our opponent style of playing.  So 
we are working on that and 
definitely I cannot reveal all 
our amendments and all our 
strategies, but I need some 
more time to adapt with my 
new coach, so it’s going well. 
Q. This name ‘Bhavani’ suits 
you so much. A synonym to 
Hindu goddess Durga. Do you 
feel that power. You are a fencer, 
an individual identity of yours, 
whom would you like to give the 
credit?
Q. In India when it comes to 
fencing we can only remember 
your name. We can’t see more 
names apart from you. Can you 
quote some particular reason? 
A. Actually everyone came 
to know about fencing after I qualified for the Tokyo 
Olympics. So I think right 
now we are getting support 
from the government, from 
the private organizations. So 
I’m sure in the near future 
we will see more emerging 
champions from fencing. 
Q. So have you qualified for 
the Paris Olympics and Asian 
Games, or are you still to give 
the trials in the month of March? 
A. Yes, for Paris we have 
a qualification for one year 
which will start from next 
year. For Asian Games, 
I think we will have the 
qualification in the month of 
March next year.
C.A. Bhavani Devi 
win the Commonwealth 
Championships, registering 
her victory at the 2019 edition in Canberra, Australia. 
We spoke to her exclusively at a sports event held 
A. Yes, definitely infact 
my name was kept on her 
name only. It’s a symbolic 
of women power.  I love 
playing sports and my family has been supporting me 
throughout and they have 
supported me tremendously 
more than anyone else. Credit definitely goes to them. So 
I think it’s because of the 
strength and motivation I 
get from them has always 
pushed me to keep walking, playing and achieving. 
Whatever I could do it’s because of them only.
Q. Bhavani, who has been 
your inspiration in your sport, 
and I mean from others also. 
A. My inspiration is Mariel 
Leigh Zagunis from USA 
in fencing. In other sports. 
I follow Sachin, Sania and 
currently Neeraj Chopra a 
lot. So everyone is inspiring 
and motivating us to achieve.
